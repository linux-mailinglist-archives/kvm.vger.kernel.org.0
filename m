If the  ',check=on' arg is given to -cpu, does it ensure that the
guest fails to startup with an incompatible feature set ? That's
really the key thing to protect the user from mistakes.

I don't know if this is the right approach or not, but we should at least
consider making use of CPU versioning here.  ie have a single "SapphireRapids"
alias, which resolves to a suitable specific CPU version depending on whether
TDX is used or not.
