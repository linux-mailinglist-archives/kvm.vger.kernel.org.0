Agreed that a msg to say EPC page is leaked is useful. However I found with current
sgx_reset_epc_page() I cannot find a suitable place to add:

Theoretically, it's not that right to add "EPC page is leaked", or even *might* (btw,
I don't think we should use *might* since it is vague), in to sgx_reset_epc_page(),
since whether leak or not is controlled by whether to call sgx_free_epc_page() upon
error, which is not in sgx_reset_epc_page(). And

	if (!sgx_reset_epc_page())
		sgx_free_epc_page();

is called 3 times so I don't want to add a msg for each of them.

I ended up with this solution: 

1) Rename existing sgx_free_epc_page() to sgx_encl_free_epc_page() to make it more
specific that it is used to free EPC page that is assigned to an enclave. 2) Wrap
non-EREMOVE part (putting back to free EPC pool) to sgx_free_epc_page() so it can be
used by virtual EPC.

In this way we can just put the error msg in sgx_encl_free_epc_page().

And as you said it's time to get RFC tag off, so I'll send out formal patch with
above solution, but w/o your Acked-by on this particular patch. Thanks :)
