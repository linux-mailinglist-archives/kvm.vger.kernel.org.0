Only Icelake server has the support for recovering from a EPT violation
on the PEBS data structures. To use it on Skylake server you would
need to pin the whole guest, but that is currently not done.

You would need a guest kernel that supports Icelake server PEBS. 4.18
would need backports for tht.
