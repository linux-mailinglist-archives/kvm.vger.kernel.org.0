I doubt this is strictly true.  This makes it sound like MCHECK is doing
*ACTUAL* verification that the memory is, in practice, convertible.
That would mean actually writing to it, which would take a long time for
a large system.

Does it *ACTUALLY* verify this?

Also, it's very odd to say that "CMRs must be physically present".  A
CMR itself is a logical construct.  The physical memory *backing* a CMR
is, something else entirely.

Hold on a sec.  Hot-removal is a two-step process.  The kernel *MUST*
know in advance that the removal is going to occur.  It follows that up
with evacuating the memory, giving the "all clear", then the actual
physical removal can occur.

I'm not sure what you're getting at with the "kernel cannot actually
prevent" bit.  No sane system actively destroys perfect good memory
content and tells the kernel about it after the fact.

I don't think this is strictly true.  It's totally possible to get a
hot-add *event* for memory which is in a CMR.  It would be another BIOS
bug, of course, but hot-remove is not a prerequisite purely for an event.

Agreed.

This doesn't seem right to me.  *If* we get a known-bogus hot-remove
event, we need to reject it.  Remember, removal is a two-step process.

I don't think there's *any* meaningful attack mitigation here.  Even if
someone managed to replace the physical address space that backed some
private memory, the integrity checksums won't match.  Memory integrity
mitigates physical replacement, not software.

Agreed.  This one _is_ important and since it supports an existing
policy, it makes sense to enforce this in the kernel.

That doesn't sound like a good resolution to me.

It conflates pure "software" hotplug operations like transitioning
memory ownership from the core mm to a driver (like device DAX).

TDX should not have *ANY* impact on purely software operations.  Period.
