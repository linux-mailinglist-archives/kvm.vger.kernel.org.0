Indeed. Not having this made some of my own tests fail on M1 as they
rely on ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.GIC being correct. I also pondered setting it
to 0 when emulating a GICv2, but that'd be a change in behaviour, and
I want to think a bit more about the effects of that.

Indeed. The guest already has another way to look into this by
checking whether the distributor allows active-less SGIs.

Thanks,
