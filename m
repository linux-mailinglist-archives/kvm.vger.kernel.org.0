Ok, there's some sanity checks that happen a little later in boot via
snp_cpuid_check_status(), after printk is enabled, that reports some
basic details to dmesg like the number of entries in the table. I can
add some additional sanity checks to flag the above case (really,
all-zero entries never make sense, since CPUID 0x0 is supposed to report
the max standard-range CPUID leaf, and leaf 0x1 at least should always
be present). I'll print a warning for such cases, add maybe dump the
cpuid the table in that case so it can be examined more easily by
owner.

Yes, but to be clear it's the entire CPUID page, including the count,
that's not measured (though it is encrypted after passing PSP
validation). Probably the biggest reason is the logistics of having
untrusted cloud vendors provide a copy of the CPUID values they plan
to pass to the guest, since a new measurement would need to be
calculated for every new configuration (using different guest
cpuflags, SMP count, etc.), since those table values will need to be
made easily-accessible to guest owner for all these measurement
calculations, and they can't be trusted so each table would need to
be checked either manually or by some tooling that could be difficult
to implement unless it was something simple like "give me the expected
CPUID values and I'll check if the provided CPUID table agrees with
that".

At that point it's much easier for the guest owner to just check the
CPUID values directly against known good values for a particular
configuration as part of their attestation process and leave the
untrusted cloud vendor out of it completely. So not measuring the
CPUID page as part of SNP attestation allows for that flexibility.

Or even more simply by the guest owner simply running 'cpuid -r -1' on
the guest after boot, and making sure all the expected entries are
present. If the HV manipulated the count to be lower, there would be
missing entries, if they manipulated it to be higher, then there would
either be extra duplicate entries at the end of the table (which the
#VC handler would ignore due to it using the first matching entry in
the table when doing lookups), or additional non-duplicate garbage
entries, which will show up in 'cpuid -r -1' as unexpected entries.

Really 'cpuid -r -1' is the guest owner/userspace view of things, so
some of these nuances about the table contents might be noteworthy,
but wouldn't actually affect guest behavior, which would be the main
thing attestation process should be concerned with.
