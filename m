We already do. KVM hides a bunch of things we don't want the guest to
see, either because we don't support the feature, or that we want to
present it with a different shape (cache topology, for example), and
these combination don't really exist in any physical implementation.

Which is why I don't really buy the "CPU model" concept as defined by
x86 and s390. We already are in a vastly different place.

The way I see it, you get a bunch of architectural features that can
be enabled/disabled depending on the underlying HW, hypervisor's
capabilities and userspace input. On top of that, there is a layer of
paint that tells you what is the overall implementation you could be
running on (that's what MIDR+REVIDR+AIDR tell you) so that you can
apply some unspeakable, uarch-specific hacks that keep the machine
going (got to love these CPU errata).

I'm not sure I get the "different software level" part. Do you mean
VMM revisions?

Thanks,
