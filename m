Hi, it's me again.

LWN said they're open for a summary article and/or a couple of in-depth
talks -- if there are volunteers.  Generally LWN audience prefers fewer
talks that go deeper.

For an in-depth article, I'm more comfortable doing Eric Blake's "NBD
and Bitmaps: Building Blocks of Change Block Tracking" talk, as I'm
somewhat familar with the topic.

Let us know if anyone else wants to do an in-depth article on any of the
other KVM Forum talks.
