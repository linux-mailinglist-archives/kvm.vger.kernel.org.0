And to be clear, if the host kernel was doing the wrong thing, it
would take a *physical* SError. And on the M1, it really doesn't
matter as there is no physical GIC.

I have very little hope that we can get Apple to give us anything
here. The CPU doesn't even advertise that it has a vGIC, so we're in
uncharted territories. But we could definitely key that on the MIDR.
