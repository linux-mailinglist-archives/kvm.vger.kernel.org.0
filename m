Thanks for the detailed explanation. One part which confuses me here...
Why can't userspace impose those same limits using a (TOD, value) tuple?
Userspace can still look at that TOD from before the brownout period
started, and declare that is too far in the past.

If the event happens *after* userspace has decided that the migration was
quick enough, but before the vCPUs are actually running again, even the
offset based interface doesn't protect against that.

Hm, I need to do some more thinking here. I poked at this because for TSC
scaling even before we think about clock jumps it was just utterly hosed â€”
userspace naively just creates a bunch of vCPUs and sets their TSC
frequency + value, and they all end up with unsynced TSC values.

But coincidentally since then I have started having conversations with
people who really want the guest to have an immediate knowledge of the
adjtimex maxerror etc. on the new host immediately after the migration.
Maybe the "if the migration isn't fast enough then let the guest know it's
now unsynced" is OK, but I'll need to work out what "immediately" means
when we have a guest userspace component involved in it.

I'll need to do that with a real screen and keyboard though, and fingers
that aren't freezing as I sit by a 9-year-old's hockey training...
