No and yes.

No because they should be used when pci_{load,stor,store_block} are 
interpreted AFAIU.
And currently we only use interception.

Yes, because, the CLP part, use to setup the translations IIUC, (do not 
ask me for details now), will need to be re-issued by the kernel after 
some modifications and this will also need a way from QEMU S390 PCI down 
to the ZPCI driver.
Way that I try to setup with this patch.

So answer is not now but we should keep in mind that we will 
definitively need a way down to the zpci low level in the host.

thanks, it is yes better to explain better :)

yes, right

No they are not.

For emulated cards, all is done inside QEMU, we do not need kernel 
access, the emulated cards get a specific emulation function and group 
assigned with pre-defined values.

I sent a QEMU patch related to this.
Even the kernel interface will change with the changes in the kernel 
patch, the emulation should continue in this way.
