Overall, this looks pretty good, and I only have a few nits on the
first three patches. I'll let Andrew comment on the selftest, which
looks OK to me at least on the surface.

Another nit: In the future, please consider basing your series on a
stable tag (such as v5.14-rc4), as kvmarm/next is a bit of a moving
target (the individual commits are stable, but the merge commits
aren't). Basing something off -next should be reserved for the cases
where you are fixing something that is only broken there.

Thanks,

Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.
