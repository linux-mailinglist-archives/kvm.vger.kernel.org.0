Incremental should always be preferred if possible.

For a), my answer will be starting with pgtable mgmts.  I actually
commented on this one a few months ago and didn't get a response:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZItfYxrTNL4Mu%2Flo@x1n/#r

        I didn't read HGM for a long time, but afair a few hundreds of LOCs
        lie in the pgtable walking changes which should probably be
        accounted into "adding complexity" if we say hugetlb will converge
        one day with core mm.  That's one (out of many issues) that Matthew
        listed in his slides yesterday that hugetlb may need an eye looking
        at for convergence.

        Does it mean that this might be a good spot to pay some more
        attention?  I know this goes back to the very early stage where we
        were discussing what would be the best way to walk hugetlb pgtable
        knowing that we can map 4K over a 2M, but I think it may be
        slightly different: at least we're clearer that now we want to
        merge that with core mm.

        I think it means the possibility to mostly deprecate
        huge_pte_offset().  James/Mike/anyone, have any of you looked into
        that area?  Would above make any sense at all?

But that's really only my 2 cents.  It could be that I miss something
important so this just won't work.  If James stopped working on it, I'm
happy to spend some time exploring in this direction and see what I can
get.  It'll still take some time, though.. so hopefully nothing should need
to be blocked on this.

I see, but then is it userspace relevant?  IMHO we should discuss the
proposal based only on the design itself, rather than relying on any
details on possible userspace implementations if two mappings are not
required but optional.

Agreed.  Providing alternative solutions definitely have the risk of
maintenance burden in the future.
