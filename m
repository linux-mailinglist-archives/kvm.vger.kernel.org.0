INT3 is trap-like, i.e. the VM-Exit occurs after the instruction retires.
It's impossible for software to know how far to unwind RIP without the
instruction length being provided by hardware/KVM, e.g. if the guest is
being silly and prepends ignored prefixes on the INT3.

Self-aware software has a priori knowledge of what's being patched in,
and practically speaking I don't any well-behaved sane software uses
prefixes with INT3, but from a VMM's perspective it's legal and possible.
