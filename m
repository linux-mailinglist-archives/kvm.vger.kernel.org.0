Hi,

My name is Cyrille Brouard, the financial director of INVENTIV HEALTH
CLINICAL FRANCE SARL situated in Nante, France. The company is a
pharmaceutical firm that is mainly into research and production of drugs.

I am personally contacting you base on a business proposition that i feel
will be beneficial for both parties. Majority of the ingredients used in
production by the company are procured from Asia and Middle east which is
the reason why I'm contacting you.

ARTEMISININ B16+ OIL is one of the most expensive Raw material in our
Anti-cancer Integrative medical production and is not risky or illegal
product by any country law as it=E2=80=99s used in producing Integrative me=
dicine
which is for healing-oriented medicine for all forms of cancers.

Formerly our company purchases from some Sri Lanka supplier but the product
are found in India and which is the same place where the Sri Lanka supplier
source from. Recently I confidentially got the contact of the local dealer
in India and I came to know that this product is sold at 2,300=E2=82=AC fro=
m
India but it is supplied to my company at the rate 5,600=E2=82=AC per litre=
. I
have the contact of the India local dealer of which I don't want to release
to my director since I have personal interest in the business.

Therefore, I am looking for a reliable and competent business person that
can invest in buying from the local dealer in India at the rate of 2,300=E2=
=82=AC
or even less and proposing to sell this product to my company at the rate
of 5,000=E2=82=AC. I can assure you that base on this price, my company wil=
l be
tempted in contracting you to be their official supplier.

I am interested in 30% of the profit after you deduct all your cost of
expenditure during supply.

Please note that:

1) I can't easily release this contact because if my company knows about
it, they will consult legal petition against me.
2) I can't go to India to purchase this product due to my financial
setbacks and my active service with the company.

Please note that your delay in response will urge me to source another
reliable person to do the supply.  Reply me through this email address:
bcyrille687@gmail.com

Looking forward to hear from you.

Regards,
Cyrille.
