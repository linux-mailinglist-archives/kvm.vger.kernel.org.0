Yes. We can add the check to validate the hardware is not bigger than 4 
for future processors. Intel folks are supposed to send new patches 
before silicon with more than 4 PT_ADDR_RANGE delivered.

My concern was that change userspace's input silently is not good. If 
you prefer this, we certainly need to extend the userspace to query what 
value is finally accepted and set by KVM.
