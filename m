Only Faithful Believe.

How are you? Hope everything goes well.

Although I am not comfortable to send this proposal to you because of
increase in SCAM and FRAUD especially in Africa. It's my pleasure to
brief you with this. I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In
my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, I want to tell you this because
I don't have any other option than to tell you as I was touched to
open up to you, I married to Mr.Sangoule Agima who was exporter of
Gold from Burkina Faso mining to worldwide for ten years before he
died in the year 2010.We were married for 16 years without a child. He
died after a brief illness that lasted for only six days. Since his
death I decided not to remarry, when my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum of US$ 8.5M (eight million five hundred united
dollars) in bank and presently this money is still in bank, He made
this money available for exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining
to worldwide.

Recently, I suffer from throat cancer terminally ill. My Doctor told
me that I am condemned to certain death due to cancer problem. The one
that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness .Having known my condition
I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the
less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going
to instruct herein.

As soon a s I receive your reply I will instruct the Bank Manger to
immediately transfer you the fund.
I await your prompt reply.Please send the following: Reply To This
E-mail Address sameraagima223@gmail.com

Yours sincerely.

Mrs. Samira Agima
