The problem is that the dirty ring mechanism is a bit blinkered, and
cannot consider a source of dirty pages other than from the vcpus.

Why another capability? Just allowing dirty logging to be enabled
before we saving the GIC state should be enough, shouldn't it?

Yes, this will also need some work.

No, I'm talking about an actual HW SMMU using the HTTU feature that
set the Dirty bit in the PTEs. And people have been working on sharing
SMMU and CPU PTs for some time, which would give us the one true
source of dirty page.

In this configuration, the dirty ring mechanism will be pretty useless.
