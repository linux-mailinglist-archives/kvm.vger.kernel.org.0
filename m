My take on this is that it is a fictional use case. In my experience,
migration happens across *identical* systems, and *any* difference
visible to guests will cause things to go wrong. Errata management
gets in the way, as usual (name *one* integration that isn't broken
one way or another!).

Allowing migration across heterogeneous hosts requires a solution to
the errata management problem, which everyone (including me) has
decided to ignore so far (and I claim that not having a constant timer
frequency exposed to guests is an architecture bug).

SDEI? Sigh... Why would SDEI be useful for NV and not for !NV?

And have yet another set of band aids that paper over the fact that we
can't get a consistent story on virtualization? No, thank you.

NV is (IMHO) much more important than LPT as it has a chance of
getting used. LPT is just another tick box, and the fact that ARM is
ready to ignore sideline a decent portion of the architecture is a
clear sign that it hasn't been thought out.

I do, see above. I'm stating that the use case doesn't really exist
given the state of the available HW and the fragmentation of the
architecture, and that ignoring the most important innovation in the
virtualization architecture since ARMv7 is at best short-sighted.

Time scaling is just an instance of the errata management problem, and
that is the issue that needs solving. Papering over part of the
problem is not helping.
