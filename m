--- Comment #4 from muncrief (rmuncrief@humanavance.com) ---
Oh yeah, as I assumed it was pilot error. After I finished my other tasks for
the day and had a few minutes to concentrate on the bisect output I realized I
probably had to compile the exact initial version for bisect to work in Arch.
And indeed once I created a custom PKGBUILD the first bisect compilation
completed without error.

It's too late to continue this evening, but I don't have any tasks scheduled
for the first part of the day tomorrow so I'll concentrate solely on the bisect
and hopefully get a bit further this time.
