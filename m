in v12, I added
[PATCH v12 14/15] iommu/smmuv3: Accept configs with more than one
context descriptor

I don't think you need to add s1cdmax addition as we already have
pasid_bits which should do the job.

in v12 I added [PATCH v12 15/15] iommu/smmuv3: Add PASID cache
invalidation per PASID. I have not tested it though.

Since I have rebase on 5.10-rc4 you will still have this duplication to
handle.

in v12 I added a new VFIO region to inject your fault. This was tested
with dummy event injection, this should work properly.

If we clearly identify all the public dependencies needed for vSVA/ARM I
can help you respinning on top of them

Thanks
