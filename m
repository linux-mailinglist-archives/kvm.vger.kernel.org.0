Hello Dear.

My greetings to you and the family, I am using this medium to request
your assistance in transferring ownership of an abandoned sum of
$25.300,000.00 usd, I discovered these funds during last year auditing
in my bank which also discovered that my bank has made lots of profits
so many years with the funds haven't discovered the relative of the
deceased. I'm Ms. So Daum, a Republic of South Korean Nationality; I'm
the Director Foreign Remittance Department of my Bank Branch Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto, Canada. Please if you are
interested in handling these opportunities with me without breach of
trust please kindly send the following details below so that we can
open up communication to that effect.

After more than 8years ago my bank made a public notice to release the
funds to relatives of the deceased who may apply for the claim but to
no avail up to date. I am contacting you in connection to present you
to my bank as the relative of the late deceased to enable my bank to
release the funds to us, This transaction is 100% risk free and
confidential so that you should not entertain any fear now and after
the successful transfer of the funds. Once the funds are transferred
into any reliable bank account that you are going to provide for the
transfer, You will be entitled for 40% of the total funds as my
foreign partner and in respect of the provision of a reliable bank
account that you will provide for the transfer. 50% will be for me as
the pioneer of the transaction; then 10% will be set outside for any
expenditure.

disappointment kindly provide the information below..
