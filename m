But PCI clearly isn't the case we are dealing with here, and not
everything is VFIO either. I can *today* create a driver that
implements a mmap+fault handler, call mmap() on it, pass the result to
a memslot, and get to the exact same result Santosh describes.

No PCI, no VFIO, just a random driver. We are *required* to handle
that.
