Maybe there's a good reason for that.

So imagine whoever creates those, starts putting stuff in those fields.
Then, in the future, the spec decides to rename those reserved/unused
fields into something else and starts putting concrete values in them.
I.e., it starts using them for something.

But, now the spec breaks existing usage because those fields are already
in use. And by then it doesn't matter what the spec says - existing
usage makes it an ABI.

So we start doing expensive and ugly workarounds just so that we don't
break the old, undocumented use which the spec simply silently allowed,
and accomodate that new feature the spec adds.

So no, what you're thinking is a bad bad idea.

So I went and applied the rest of the series. And I think you mean
do_vc_no_ghcb() and it doing snp_cpuid().

Then, looking at sev_enable() and it calling snp_init(), you fail
further init if there's any discrepancy in the supplied data - CPUID,
SEV status MSR, etc.

So, practically, what you wanna test in all those places is whether
you're a SNP guest or not. Which we already have:

	sev_status & MSR_AMD64_SEV_SNP_ENABLED

so, unless I'm missing something, you don't need yet another
<bla>_active() helper.

Yah, the gist of that needs to be as a comment of that line as it is not
obvious (at least to me).

Ditto. Also a comment ontop please.

This has the same theoretical problem as the reserved/unused fields. If
you don't enforce it, people will do whatever and once it is implemented
in hypervisors and it has become an ABI, you can't change it anymore.

So I'd very strongly suggest you tighten in up upfront and only allow
stuff later, when it makes sense. Not the other way around.

Thx.
