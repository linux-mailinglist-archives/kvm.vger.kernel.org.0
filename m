I'm wondering how we should try to model this, given that
cpu_model_advertised_features is a bit of a weird mix of architecture
flags and implementation-specific knobs.

Given that there are some KVM patchsets floating around to allow
userspace to limit some features for migration compat handling, I don't
think it will be too long before we'll try to figure out how to do cpu
models for KVM in QEMU as well...
