Introduce a paravirtualization interface for KVM/arm64 to obtain the VCPU
is currently running or not.

The PV lock structure of the guest is allocated by user space.

A hypercall interface is provided for the guest to interrogate the
hypervisor's support for this interface and the location of the shared
memory structures.

+Paravirtualized lock support for arm64
+======================================
+
+KVM/arm64 provides some hypervisor service calls to support a paravirtualized
+guest obtaining the VCPU is currently running or not.
+
+Two new SMCCC compatible hypercalls are defined:
+
+* PV_LOCK_FEATURES:   0xC6000020
+* PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED:  0xC6000021
+
+The existence of the PV_LOCK hypercall should be probed using the SMCCC 1.1
+ARCH_FEATURES mechanism before calling it.
+
+PV_LOCK_FEATURES
+    ============= ========    ==========
+    Function ID:  (uint32)    0xC6000020
+    PV_call_id:   (uint32)    The function to query for support.
+    Return value: (int64)     NOT_SUPPORTED (-1) or SUCCESS (0) if the relevant
+                              PV-lock feature is supported by the hypervisor.
+    ============= ========    ==========
+
+PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED
+    ============= ========    ==========
+    Function ID:  (uint32)    0xC6000021
+    Return value: (int64)     NOT_SUPPORTED (-1) or SUCCESS (0) if the IPA of
+                              this VCPU's pv data structure is configured by
+                              the hypervisor.
+    ============= ========    ==========
+
+The IPA returned by PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED should be mapped by the guest as normal
+memory with inner and outer write back caching attributes, in the inner
+shareable domain.
+
+PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED returns the structure for the calling VCPU.
+
+PV lock state
+-------------
+
+The structure pointed to by the PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED hypercall is as follows:
+
++-----------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------+
+| Field     | Byte Length | Byte Offset | Description                     |
++===========+=============+=============+=================================+
+| preempted |      8      |      0      | Indicate the VCPU who owns this |
+|           |             |             | struct is running or not.       |
+|           |             |             | Non-zero values mean the VCPU   |
+|           |             |             | has been preempted. Zero means  |
+|           |             |             | the VCPU is not preempted.      |
++-----------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------+
+
+The preempted field will be updated to 1 by the hypervisor prior to scheduling
+a VCPU. When the VCPU is scheduled out, the preempted field will be updated
+to 0 by the hypervisor.
+
+The structure will be present within a reserved region of the normal memory
+given to the guest. The guest should not attempt to write into this memory.
+There is a structure per VCPU of the guest.
+
+For the user space interface see Documentation/virt/kvm/devices/vcpu.txt
+section "4. GROUP: KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVLOCK_CTRL".
