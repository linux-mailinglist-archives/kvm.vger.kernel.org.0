We need event creation and pass-through for both read and write.

The LBR driver would firstly access the MSR_LBR_SELECT to configure branch 
types
and we also create LBR event for GUEST_IA32_DEBUGCTL.DEBUGCTLMSR_LBR=1 trap.
A lazy approach requests more cached values and more traps.

We have done this via releasing the LBR event for next creation and 
pass-through try.

Not a big but concern one. To hit that, we need run LBR agent on the host
and grab LBR from the guest. And it's not covered in the current test cases
since we do not recommend this kind of usage in the comment.

a #GP crash in the host ï¼ŸCan you share more understanding about it ?
