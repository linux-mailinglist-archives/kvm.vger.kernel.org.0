+Hot plug support:
+================
+An adapter, domain or control domain may be hot plugged into a running KVM
+guest by assigning it to the vfio_ap mediated device being used by the guest if
+the following conditions are met:
+
+* The adapter, domain or control domain must also be assigned to the host's
+  AP configuration.
+
+* To hot plug an adapter, each APQN derived from the Cartesian product
+  comprised APID of the adapter being assigned and the APQIs of the domains
+  assigned must reference a queue device bound to the vfio_ap device driver.
+
+* To hot plug a domain, each APQN derived from the Cartesian product

+  assigned must reference a queue device bound to the vfio_ap device driver.
+
+Over-provisioning of AP queues for a KVM guest:
+==============================================
+Over-provisioning is defined herein as the assignment of adapters or domains to
+a vfio_ap mediated device that do not reference AP devices in the host's AP
+configuration. The idea here is that when the adapter or domain becomes
+available, it will be automatically hot-plugged into the KVM guest using
+the vfio_ap mediated device to which it is assigned as long as each new APQN
+resulting from plugging it in references a queue device bound to the vfio_ap
+device driver.
+
 Limitations
 ===========
-* The KVM/kernel interfaces do not provide a way to prevent restoring an APQN
-  to the default drivers pool of a queue that is still assigned to a mediated
-  device in use by a guest. It is incumbent upon the administrator to
-  ensure there is no mediated device in use by a guest to which the APQN is
-  assigned lest the host be given access to the private data of the AP queue
-  device such as a private key configured specifically for the guest.
+Live guest migration is not supported for guests using AP devices without
+intervention by a system administrator. Before a KVM guest can be migrated,
+the vfio_ap mediated device must be removed. Unfortunately, it can not be
+removed manually (i.e., echo 1 > /sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix/$UUID/remove) while
+the mdev is in use by a KVM guest. If the guest is being emulated by QEMU,
+its mdev can be hot unplugged from the guest in one of two ways:
+
+1. If the KVM guest was started with libvirt, you can hot unplug the mdev via
+   the following commands:
+
+      virsh detach-device <guestname> <path-to-device-xml>
+
+      For example, to hot unplug mdev 62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804 from
+      the guest named 'my-guest':
+
+         virsh detach-device my-guest ~/config/my-guest-hostdev.xml
+
+            The contents of my-guest-hostdev.xml:
+
+            <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='mdev' managed='no' model='vfio-ap'>
+              <source>
+                <address uuid='62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804'/>
+              </source>
+            </hostdev>
+
+
+      virsh qemu-monitor-command <guest-name> --hmp "device-del <device-id>"
+
+      For example, to hot unplug the vfio_ap mediated device identified on the
+      qemu command line with 'id=hostdev0' from the guest named 'my-guest':
+
+         virsh qemu-monitor-command my-guest --hmp "device_del hostdev0"
+
+2. A vfio_ap mediated device can be hot unplugged by attaching the qemu monitor
+   to the guest and using the following qemu monitor command:
+
+      (QEMU) device-del id=<device-id>
+
+      For example, to hot unplug the vfio_ap mediated device that was specified
+      on the qemu command line with 'id=hostdev0' when the guest was started:
+
+         (QEMU) device-del id=hostdev0
+
+After live migration of the KVM guest completes, an AP configuration can be
+restored to the KVM guest by hot plugging a vfio_ap mediated device on the target
+system into the guest in one of two ways:
+
+1. If the KVM guest was started with libvirt, you can hot plug a matrix mediated
+   device into the guest via the following virsh commands:
+
+   virsh attach-device <guestname> <path-to-device-xml>
+
+      For example, to hot plug mdev 62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804 into
+      the guest named 'my-guest':
+
+         virsh attach-device my-guest ~/config/my-guest-hostdev.xml

+            The contents of my-guest-hostdev.xml:

+              </source>

+

+   virsh qemu-monitor-command <guest-name> --hmp \
+   "device_add vfio-ap,sysfsdev=<path-to-mdev>,id=<device-id>"

+      For example, to hot plug the vfio_ap mediated device
