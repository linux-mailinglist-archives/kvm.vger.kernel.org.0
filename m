That still needs to dynamically create mmap cookies - which is really the
whole problem here. It is not so easy to just change the existing code
with hardwired math converting pgoff to indexes to support multiple
indexes.

It doesn't matter. Fixing how mmap works internally lets you use all
of those options.

I don't think we need sub-regions, it is too complicated in the kernel
and pretty much useless.

I think I said before, adding more region indexes just makes a PITA
for the driver to manage this.

Indexes should refer to the physical object, the BAR in PCI. This is
easy for the drivers to manage, any easy for userspace to understand.

If you make dynamic indexes then every driver needs its own scheme to
map them to physical indexes and we end up re-inventing the maple tree
stuff without the cleanup or generality it brings.

Exactly. You have changed the underlying meaning of the cookie
dynamicaly.

It doesn't. It just makes a messy uapi. At the time of mmap the vma
would stil have to capture the attributes (no fault by fault!) into
the VMA so we will see real users doing things like:

 set to wc(cookie)
 mmap(cookie + XXX)
 set to !wc(cookie)
 mmap(cookie + YY)

And then if you try to debug this all our file/vma debug tools will
just show cookie everywhere with no distinction that some VMAs are WC
and some VMAs are !WC.

Basically, it fundamentally breaks how pgoff is supposed to work here
by making its meaning unstable.

Indeed, that is required for most HW. mlx5 for example has BARs that
mix WC and non WC access modes. There are too few BARs for most HW to
be able to dedicate an entire BAR to WC only.

We've already confused returning the mmap cookie and the other
information about the region. If you want to have flags to customize
what mmap cookie is returned, this is the simplest answer.

There is only one index. You can ask for different mmap options, and
pgoff space for them is created dynamically.

A "region" is not a mmap cookie, a region can have multiple mmap cookies.

It would not be another region index. That is the whole point. It is
another pgoff for an existing index.

I think that's just wrong userspace, sorry. :(

Still, we want to do this anyhow as the VMA alignment stuff Peter was
working on also requires pgoff alignment.

This is not how the mm ever works *anywhere* in the main kernel, the
only reason I can see you are propsing this because it avoids doing
the cleanup work.

It makes it impossible for userspace to get both WC and non-WC
mappings. It makes it indeterminate what behavior userspace gets at
every store operation. Real HW like mlx5 would need mixed WC/!WC on
the same bar, so I view this as an entirely bad uAPI.

Extra complexity in the kernel, no usecase that isn't already handled
by mmap directly.

What is the "multiple mapping problem" ? We've discussed this
extensively with ARM when we added WC support to KVM and I think we
have a general agreement that multiple mappings are not something the
kernel needs to actively prevent, in the limited case of WC and !WC.

All the uAPI proposals I've seen are all trying to work around the
current state of the code.

This is broadly what I've proposed consistently since the beginning,
adjusted for the various remarks since:

struct vfio_region_get_mmap {
	__u32	argsz;
	__u32	region_index; // only one, no aliases
	__u32   mmap_flags; // Set WC here

	__aligned_u64 region_size;
	__aligned_u64 fd_offset;
};

struct vfio_region_get_caps {
	__u32	argsz;
	__u32	region_index;

	__u32	region_flags; // READ/WRITE/etc
	__aligned_u64 region_size;
	__u32	cap_offset;	/* Offset within info struct of first cap */
};

Alex, you pointed out that the parsing of the existing
VFIO_DEVICE_GET_REGION_INFO has made it non-extendable. So the above
two are creating a new extendable version that are replacements.

To avoid the naming confusion we have a specific ioctl to get
mmap'able access, and another one for the cap list. I guess this also
gives access to read/write so maybe the name needs more bikeshedding.

Compared to the existing we add a single new concept, 'mmap_flags',
which customizes how the fd_offset will behave with mmap. The kernel
will internally de-duplicate region_index/mmap_flags -> fd_offset.

There is still one index per physical object (ie BAR) in the uAPI.

We get one cookie that describes the VMA behavior exactly and immutably.

The existing VFIO_DEVICE_GET_REGION_INFO is expressed in terms of the
above two operations with mmap_flags = 0.

No new subregion concept. No alias region indexes. No changing the
meaning of returned cookies.

We simply allow the userspace to request a mmap cookie for a region
index that will always cause mmap to create a VMA with WC pgrot.

If we someday want cachable, or ARM's DEVICE_GRE or whatever we can
trivially add more flags to mmap_flags and userspace can get
more cookies.

If we later decide we need to solve the ARM multi-device issue then we
can cleanly extend an additional start/len to vfio_region_get_mmap
which can ensure mmaps cookies are disjoint. This is not subregions,
or new regions, this is just a cookie with a restriction.

In terms of implementation once you do the maple tree work that
Mahmoud started we end up with vfio_region_get_mmap allocating a
struct vfio_mmap for each unique region_index/mmap_flags and returning
it to userspace.

All the drivers will use the struct vfio_mmap everywhere instead of
trying to decode pgoff to index with macros. Inside the vfio_mmap we
store the index for the driver to use directly. The driver has a
simple implementation, one index mapped to one physical resource. A
pgprot value in the struct vfio_mmap to specify how to create the VMA.

No dynamic driver aware regions or subregions.
