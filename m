sorry, it is my carelessness. it should be packed structures.

I used this structures to get its actual total size and member offset in [PATCH v17 10/10].
If it is not packed structures, the total size and member offset may be not right.

Thanks, I appreciated that you can have a test.

I still do not upload repo, you can reset to below commit[1] in master and apply this series.

BTWï¼š
If test series, you should make an guest memory hardware error, let guest access the error address, then it will happen RAS error.
I provide a software hard code method to test this series, you can refer to https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg619771.html
