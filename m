If it helps, the pattern is somewhat similar to kobject, which has a kobject_del
function (kref doesn't). kboject_del decrements the reference count only if the
parent is not NULL, then sets parent to NULL. The patch does what kobject_del
would have done if it didn't have a kref embedded in it.

There are a number of inconsistencies in both files: mmio doesn't have its own
header file and ioport has, kvm__deregister_mmio should use unregister (like
ioport), it returns bool instead of an int (like ioport), when unregistering a
mmio region we call KVM_UNREGISTER_COALESCED_MMIO unconditionally, ioport
unregisters all ioports on exit and mmio doesn't, ioport creates a new device for
each call to ioport__register, etc, etc. Not to mention the fact that ioport is
used for architectures that don't have the notion of I/O ports. I think these
issues deserve their own cleanup series.

Thanks,
Alex
