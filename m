I quite like the overall direction. I've left a few comments here and
there, and will probably get back to it after I try to run some tests
on a big-ish box.

It'd be really good to have upstream-based numbers, with details of
the actual setup (device assignment? virtio?) so that we can compare
things and even track regressions in the future.

Thanks,
