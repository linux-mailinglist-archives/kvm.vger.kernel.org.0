Well, that commit has since disappeared, as git cannot find it (as
demonstrated above). Which is why I insist on a public tag as a base,
as everything else is completely volatile.

No. You base your own series on an -rc (ideally, -rc3). If there is a
conflict with another series, it is our job (Oliver and I) to fix it
(bonus points if you indicate a resolution for the conflict in the
cover letter).

If there is a hard dependency (something that would actively prevent
your series from working at all), you cherry-pick the minimal set of
patches that makes your own series functional as a *prefix*, and post
the whole thing, including the patches you depend on. Oliver and I
will make sure the common prefix is dealt with without duplication.

And for what it is worth, this series directly applies on v6.6-rc3
without a conflict.
