Ah, I got confused by this code in snp_build_guest_buf():

	data->req_paddr = __sme_set(req_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT);

I was thinking that setting the C-bit meant the memory was guest private, but
that's setting the C-bit for the HPA, which is correct since KVM installs guest
memory with C-bit=1 in the NPT, i.e. encrypts shared memory with the host key.

Tangetially related question, is it correct to say that the host can _read_ memory
from a page that is assigned=1, but has asid=0?  I.e. KVM can read the response
page in order to copy it into the guest, even though it is a firmware page?

	/* Copy the response after the firmware returns success. */
	rc = kvm_write_guest(kvm, resp_gpa, sev->snp_resp_page, PAGE_SIZE);

Since KVM can peek at the request header, KVM should flat out disallow requests
that KVM doesn't explicitly support.  E.g. migration requests should not be sent
to the PSP.

One concern though: How does the guest query what requests are supported?  This
snippet implies there's some form of enumeration:

  Note: This guest message may be removed in future versions as it is redundant
  with the CPUID page in SNP_LAUNCH_UPDATE (see Section 8.14).

But all I can find is a "Message Version" in "Table 94. Message Type Encodings",
which implies that request support is all or nothing for a given version.  That
would be rather unfortunate as KVM has no way to tell the guest that something
is unsupported :-(

Userspace definitely cares, otherwise the system would need to be rebooted just to
tune the ratelimiting.  And userspace may want to disable ratelimiting entirely,
e.g. if the entire system is dedicated to a single VM.

I get that it will be variable, but what are some ballpark latencies?  E.g. what's
the latency of the slowest command without PSP contention?

Technically that's not required from the guest's perspective, correct?  The guest
only cares about the sequence numbers for a given VMPCK, e.g. it can have one
in-flight request per VMPCK and expect that to work, even without fully serializing
its own requests.

Out of curiosity, why 4 VMPCKs?  It seems completely arbitrary.

But KVM can't rely on that because it doesn't control the guest, e.g. it may be
running a non-Linux guest.

Ya, where I was going with my question was that if the guest was architecturally
restricted to a single in-flight request, then KVM could do something like this
instead of taking kvm->lock (bad pseudocode):

	if (test_and_set(sev->guest_request)) {
		rc = AEAD_OFLOW;
		goto fail;
	}

	<do request>

	clear_bit(...)

I.e. multiple in-flight requests can't work because the guest can guarantee
ordering between vCPUs.  But, because the guest can theoretically have up to four
in-flight requests, it's not that simple.

The reason I'm going down this path is that taking kvm->lock inside vcpu->mutex
violates KVM's locking rules, i.e. is susceptibl to deadlocks.  Per kvm/locking.rst,

  - kvm->lock is taken outside vcpu->mutex

That means a different mutex is needed to protect the guest request pages.

Again, what the Linux kernel does is irrelevant.  What matters is what is
architecturally allowed.
