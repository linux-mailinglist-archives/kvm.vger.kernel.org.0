Basically we don't want to modify page allocator API to distinguish TDX and non-
TDX allocation.  For instance, we don't want a new GFP_TDX.

There's another series done by Chao "KVM: mm: fd-based approach for supporting
KVM guest private memory" which essentially allows KVM to ask guest memory
backend to allocate page w/o having to mmap() to userspace. Â 

https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20220310140911.50924-1-chao.p.peng@linux.intel.com/

More specifically, memfd will support a new MFD_INACCESSIBLE flag when it is
created so all pages associated with this memfd will be TDX capable memory.  The
backend will need to implement a new memfile_notifier_ops to allow KVM to get
and put the memory page.

struct memfile_pfn_ops {
	long (*get_lock_pfn)(struct inode *inode, pgoff_t offset, int *order);
	void (*put_unlock_pfn)(unsigned long pfn);
};

With that, it is backend's responsibility to implement get_lock_pfn() callback
in which the backend needs to ensure a TDX private page is allocated.

For TD guest, KVM should enforced to only use those fd-based backend.  I am not
sure whether anonymous pages should be supported anymore.

Sean, please correct me if I am wrong?

Currently only shmem is extended to support it.  By ensuring pages in page
allocator are all TDX memory, shmem can be extended easily to support TD guests.
Â 
If device-dax and hugetlbfs wants to support TD guests then they should
implement those callbacks and ensure only TDX memory is allocated.  For
instance, when future TDX supports NVDIMM (i.e. NVDIMM is included to CMRs),
then device-dax pages can be included as TDX memory when initializing the TDX
module and device-dax can implement it's own to support allocating page for TD
guests.

But TDX architecture can be changed to support memory hotplug in a more graceful
way in the future.  For instance, it can choose to support dynamically adding
any convertible memory as TDX memory *after* TDX module initialization.  But
this is just my brainstorming.

Anyway, for now, since only shmem (or + anonymous pages) can be used to create
TD guests, I think we can just reject any memory hot-add when platform supports
TDX as described in the first simple approach.  Eventually we may need something
like the second approach but TDX architecture can evolve too.
