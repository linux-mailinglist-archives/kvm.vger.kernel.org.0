Allocating anonymous memory is more complex now. And I could argue than the
hugetlbfs case is also more complex because there are now two branches that
do different things based whether it's hugetlbfs or not, instead of one.

As I stands right now, my opinion is that using memfd for anonymous RAM
only adds complexity for zero benefits.

How is all of the code that has been added easier to reason about than one
single mmap call?

Can you point me to the arch-specific code that this series removes? As far
as I can tell, the only arch specfic change is replacing
kvm_arch_delete_ram with kvm_delete_ram, which can be done independently of
this series. If it's only that function, I wouldn't call that "a lot" of
arch-specific code.

kvmtool can be used to run virtual machines when pKVM is not enabled. In
fact, it has been used that way for way longer than pKVM has existed. What
about those users?

If you're not sure how it will end up looking, then why change kvmtool now?
