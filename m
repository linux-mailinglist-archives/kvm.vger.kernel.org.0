I was suggesting keeping the defaults the same when your new gic 
attribute is untouched but in the same way that it overrides enable to 
disable you could also allow it to override disable to enable.

Based on Marc's comments this does not seem desirable. As things are 
now, and with your changes, setting kvm-arm.vgic_v4_enable=1 at boot 
implies a promise that vgic_v4 works on the system. As there is broken 
hardware we can't take this promise for granted.
