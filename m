I am a foreign delegate from the United Nations fund recovery
committee office/ compensation directive office,you are among the
compensated victims of scam, and we have been ordered to offer you the
sum of US$2,550.000.00 .

I want you to know that during the last UN meetings held at Africa ,it
was alarmed so much by the rest of the world in the meetings on the
lost of funds by various foreigners to the scams artists operating in
syndicates all over the world today, in other to retain the good image
of the country, the president UN is now paying 50 victims of this
operators US$US$2,550.000.00 each, Due to the corrupt and inefficient
banking systems in Africa, the payments are to be wired via direct
transfer, online banking transfer or ATM visa card,

Please note that the deadline
for claiming your fund is exactly one week after the receipt of this email.
After this period, your fund will be return back to the ordering costumer.
