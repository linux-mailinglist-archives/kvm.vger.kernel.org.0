Like Marc, I argued strongly for the removal of the LPT bits on the
premise that it didn't really work (e.g. when transistioning between SW
agents) and so it wasÂ a pure maintenance burden.

I don't think the technical arguments have changed, and I don't think
it's a good idea to try to ressurect this. Please rope me in if
this comes up in internal discussions.

Mark.
