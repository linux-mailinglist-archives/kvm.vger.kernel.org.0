This is misleading.

First, the problem is not a loaded CPU. The problem is that the
task might spend very long time in the kernel when handling
some syscall.

Second, there is no timeout for the transition in the kernel code.
It might take very long time but it will not fail.

It seems that the patch works as expected but it is far from clear.
And the above description helps only partially. Let me try to
explain it for dummies like me ;-)

<explanation>
The problem was solved by sending a fake signal, see the commit
0b3d52790e1cfd6b80b826 ("livepatch: Remove signal sysfs attribute").
It was achieved by calling signal_wake_up(). It set TIF_SIGPENDING
and woke the task. It interrupted the syscall and the task was
transitioned when leaving to the userspace.

signal_wake_up() was later replaced by set_notify_signal(),
see the commit 8df1947c71ee53c7e21 ("livepatch: Replace
the fake signal sending with TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL infrastructure").
The difference is that set_notify_signal() uses TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL
instead of TIF_SIGPENDING.

The effect is the same when running on a real hardware. The syscall
gets interrupted and exit_to_user_mode_loop() is called where
the livepatch state is updated (task migrated).

But it works a different way in kvm where the task works are
called in the guest mode and the task does not return into
the user space in the host mode.
</explanation>

The solution provided by this patch is a bit weird, see below.

This looks strange:

  + klp_send_signals() calls set_notify_signal(task) that sets
    TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL

  + xfer_to_guest_mode_work() handles TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL by calling
    task_work_run().

  + This patch calls kvm_handle_signal_exit(vcpu) when
    _TIF_PATCH_PENDING is set. It probably causes the guest
    to call exit_to_user_mode_loop() because TIF_PATCH_PENDING
    bit is set. But neither TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL not TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL
    is set so that it works different way than on the real hardware.


Question:

Does xfer_to_guest_mode_work() interrupts the syscall running
on the guest?

If "yes" then we do not need to call kvm_handle_signal_exit(vcpu).
It will be enough to call:

		if (ti_work & _TIF_PATCH_PENDING)
			klp_update_patch_state(current);

If "no" then I do not understand why TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL interrupts
the syscall on the real hardware and not in kvm.

Anyway, we either should make sure that TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL has the same
effect on the real hardware and in kvm. Or we need another interface
for the fake signal used by livepatching.
