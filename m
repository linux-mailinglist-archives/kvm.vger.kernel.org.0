Increasingly desperate variations,  about sums up my process as well while
trying to get the upcall vector working.

I did use the auto_eoi hack as well. So, yeah, I don't see any way of
getting around this.

Also, IIRC we had eventually gotten rid of the auto_eoi approach
because that wouldn't work with APICv. At that point we resorted to
direct queuing for vectored callbacks which was a hack that I never
grew fond of...

Good luck to your fingers!
