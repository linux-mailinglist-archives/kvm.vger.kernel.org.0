The code has progressed somewhat in the past 3+ weeks, we still persist
all devices, but the start-up mode can be selected per device or with a
global default mode.  Devices configured with 'auto' start-up
automatically while 'manual' devices are simply known and available to
be started.  I imagine we could add a 'transient' mode where we purge
the information about the device when it is removed or the next time
the parent device is added.

I think it's an interesting feature, but it's easy enough to control
via a global option in sysconfig with the default off if it's seen as
overstepping.

Yes, Pavel brought up this issue offline as well and it needs more
consideration.  The systemd support still needs work as well, I've
discovered it gets very confused when the mdev device is removed
outside of mdevctl, but I haven't yet been able to concoct a BindsTo=
line that can handle the hyphens in the uuid device name.  I'd say
mdevctl is not intentionally systemd specific, it's simply a byproduct
of the systems it was developed on.  Also, if libvirt were to focus
only on transient devices, then startup via systemctl doesn't make
sense, which probably means stopping via systemctl would also be unused
by libvirt.  So I think this means we just need to make systemd an
optional feature of mdevctl (or drop it) and if libvirt doesn't use it,
that's fine.  Thanks,

Alex
