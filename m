Another problem. Is it safe to call kvm_handle_signal_exit(vcpu)
for kthreads?

kthreads have _TIF_PATCH_PENDING when they need the livepatch transition.
But kthreads never leave kernel so we do not send the fake signal
signals to them.

Thanks for the detailed explanation.

We do not need to check the stack when the syscall gets restarted.
The task might be transitioned only when the syscall gets restarted.

In this case, we should revert the commit 8df1947c71ee53c7e21
("livepatch: Replace the fake signal sending with TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL
infrastructure"). The flag TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL clearly does not guarantee
restarting the syscall or exiting to the user space with -EINTR.

It should solve this problem. And it looks like a cleaner solution
to me.
