If the ownership of LBR changes, there must be two (or more) LBR events
for perf event scheduling switch for current task, and the perf
subsystem callback will save the previous LBR state and restore
the state of the next LBR event considering different depths.

I couldn't agree with you more on this point.

We do have a code gap to make Arch LBR migratable for any KVM user.
