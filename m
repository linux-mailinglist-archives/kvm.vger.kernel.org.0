I guess it would be prudent to have some warnings when enumerating those
leafs and when the count index "goes off into the weeds", so to speak,
and starts reading 0-CPUID entries. I.e., "dear guest owner, your HV is
giving you a big lie: a weird/bogus CPUID leaf count..."

:-)

And lemme make sure I understand it: the ->count itself is not
measured/encrypted because you want to be flexible here and supply
different blobs with different CPUID leafs?

Yap, it is important this is properly explained there so that people can
pay attention to during attestation.

Noticeable because the guest owner did supply a CPUID table with X
entries but the HV is reporting Y?

If so, you can make this part of the attestation process: guest owners
should always check the CPUID entries count to be of a certain value.

Now you're starting to grow the right amount of paranoia - I'm glad I
was able to sensitize you properly!

No worries - the end result is important!

Thx.
