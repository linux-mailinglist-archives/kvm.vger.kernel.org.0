Hi Drew,

Thanks for reviewing this.

What do you think about adding the following to the commit message?

If you think this is sufficient, I will update the patch. If not I could 
look into adding a test in KUT but generally the code of these tests are 
generated by a tool and the coding style (if one can call it a style) is 
very different.

Thanks,
