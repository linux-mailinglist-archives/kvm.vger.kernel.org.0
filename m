Preferred shortlog prefix for KVM guest changes is "x86/kvm".  "KVM: x86" is for
host changes.

The changelog needs to explain why SEV hypercalls need to be made before
apply_alternative(), why it's ok to make Intel CPUs take #UDs on the unknown
VMMCALL, and why this is not creating the same conundrum for TDX.

Actually, I don't think making Intel CPUs take #UDs is acceptable.  This patch
breaks Linux on upstream KVM on Intel due a bug in upstream KVM.  KVM attempts
to patch the "wrong" hypercall to the "right" hypercall, but stupidly does so
via an emulated write.  I.e. KVM honors the guest page table permissions and
injects a !WRITABLE #PF on the VMMCALL RIP if the kernel code is mapped RX.

In other words, trusting the VMM to not screw up the #UD is a bad idea.  This also
makes documenting the "why does SEV need super early hypercalls" extra important.

This patch doesn't work because X86_FEATURE_VMCALL is a synthetic flag and is
only set by VMware paravirt code, which is why the patching doesn't happen as
would be expected.  The obvious solution would be to manually set X86_FEATURE_VMCALL
where appropriate, but given that defaulting to VMCALL has worked for years,
defaulting to VMMCALL makes me nervous, e.g. even if we splatter X86_FEATURE_VMCALL
into Intel, Centaur, and Zhaoxin, there's a possibility we'll break existing VMs
that run on hypervisors that do something weird with the vendor string.

Rather than look for X86_FEATURE_VMCALL, I think it makes sense to have this be
a "pure" inversion, i.e. patch in VMCALL if VMMCALL is not supported, as opposed
to patching in VMCALL if VMCALL is supproted.

Is Brijesh the author?  Co-developed-by for a one-line change would be odd...
