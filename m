Maybe it'll be better to post arm patches separately so that it can attract
more attention from arm developers specifically.

I see that PeterM is in the loop, besides you could also try to copy Eric
Auger <eric.auger@redhat.com>.  I have Eric copied.  I'm not sure whether
Eric or the team would be interested in this too at some point.

Right, this one should be easy, IMHO.  And I hope if prealloc is the only
concern then the impact is low, I mean prefaults for hugetlb pages is less
important comparing to small pages - fault one 1G page which used to be
poisoned may not even be detectable from guest as long as there're still
free 1G available.

I confess this isn't high priority for now.  Before hugetlb pages can be
split this isn't providing much help indeed, as QEMU knows whatever the
kernel knows.

It can be more important until someone allows hugetlb pages to split so
poison may only affect 4k out of 1G.  In that case it must report with 4k
of part of 1G.  We'll see how that would work out at last, we may need some
new mm interface to tell the userspace that "when I say 4k is poisoned,
it's really only that 4k..", or something like that.

Yes, thanks for fixing it.
