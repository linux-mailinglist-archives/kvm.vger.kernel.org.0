What does this addition have anything to do with the ownership of the
physical register file? Not a lot, it seems.

Specially as there better be no state resident on the CPU when
userspace messes up with it.

I totally disagree.

What performance overhead? Why should we care?

What ordering issues? If userspace manipulates the guest state, the
guest isn't running. If it is, all bets are off.

It is only unavoidable if we decide to make a bad job of it.
