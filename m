I am afraid I don't know why it's omitted. It seems that x86 and arm 
keep it:

$> git grep KEEP_FRAME_POINTER
Makefile:frame-pointer-flag=-f$(if 
$(KEEP_FRAME_POINTER),no-,)omit-frame-pointer
arm/Makefile.arm:KEEP_FRAME_POINTER := y
x86/Makefile.common:KEEP_FRAME_POINTER := y

It should be straightforward to add it for an arm64 build with debugging 
enabled, perhaps along with your other patch.

With this series and Drew's patch "arch-run: Extend timeout when booting 
with UEFI", on a standard Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (gcc version 11.3.0 and 
QEMU emulator version 6.2.0), I get the following results:

$> ./run_tests.sh
PASS selftest-setup (2 tests)
PASS selftest-vectors-kernel (3 tests)
PASS selftest-vectors-user (2 tests)
PASS selftest-smp (1 tests)

PASS cache (1 tests)
PASS debug-bp (6 tests)
SKIP debug-bp-migration
PASS debug-wp (8 tests)
SKIP debug-wp-migration
PASS debug-sstep (1 tests)
SKIP debug-sstep-migration

which is the same results I get when I build without --enable-efi, 
except for psci which requires ERRATA_6c7a5dce22b3=y to enable the 
cpu-on test. For this, I think we need to implement support for the 
ERRATA_* environmental variable.

Thanks,

Nikos
