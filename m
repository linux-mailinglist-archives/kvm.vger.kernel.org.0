It passes the self tests, after fixing the self tests to compile, so it 
must be perfect.  Oh wait. :)

Seriously: this is very nice work.  I agree with Christoph that it 
should be possible to hide it with Kconfig, but I can take care of that 
and it need not block the inclusion in linux-next.

I've queued it to kvm/queue for now; as soon as the integration tests 
finish (the amount of new stuff in 5.12 is pretty scary), it will be in 
kvm/next too.

Thanks very much!

Paolo
