Right.  I think we may need to decide whether to use the same interface to
handle no-vcpu contexts, though, and whether possible (e.g. is reusing
vcpu0 even possible?  if not consider ugliness).  For example, Anish's
proposal still need to rely on userfaults for some minority faults, IIUC.

If so, IMHO it'll be great the interface is userfault-based.  Gmemfd can be
only a special form of memfd in general, and there's also potential of
supporting memfd, then that may not require a kvm context.

It hopefully shouldn't affect how kvm consumes it, though, so from that
part it should be as straightforward as a KVM interface, just cleaner and
fully separated.

I can extend a bit on a possible userfault design, maybe it can make the
discussion clearer.

Currently userfaults registers with VA ranges, cutting them into new VMAs,
setting the flags upon the VMAs.  Files don't have those.

To vision an fd based uffd (which never existed) from my pure gut feelings,
we need to only move the VA address space to the file (or to be explicit,
inode), meaning whatever address will become offsets of a file.  It can
apply to gmemfd or generic memfd (shmem, hugetlb, etc.).  Generic memfd can
be for later, but the interface could hopefully be unchanged even if
someone would like to add support for those.

I need to think more on where to put the uffd context, probably onto the
inode, but maybe also possible to put it into gmemfd-only fields before we
want to make it more generic.  That should be a problem for later.

It could be something like ioctl(UFFDIO_REGISTER_FD) to register a normal
memory fd (gmemfd) against an userfault desc.  AFAIU it may not even
require a range of file offset to register, we can start with always
registering the file on full range, whatever large it is (0->fsize, fsize
under control of normal file/inode semantics).

It means gmemfd code will still need to check the fsize limit on over
file-size access, as long as it passes and if it's registered with UFFD-fd
mode, it reports the fault just like VMA based, but in file offset this
time.  The file-size will need to be rechecked when injecting the page
cache, failing on both sides.

We'll need correspondent new ioctl for file, say, ioctl(UFFDIO_INSERT),
which fills in the mapping entry / page cache only for the inode without
touching any pgtables.  The kicking stuff is the same as VMA-based.

Right, hugetlb 1G is still the major pain, and we can indeed resolve that
with a kvm proposal to bypass whatever issues lies in mm community, even if
not something I prefer..  I sincerely hope we can see some progress on that
side, if possible.

I fully understand why you propose that, but not the one I prefer.  That
means KVM is leaving other modules behind. :( And that's not even the same
as the case where KVM wants to resolve hugetlb over 1G, because at least we
tried :) it's just that the proposal got rejected, unfortunately, so far.

IMHO we should still consider virt the whole community, not KVM separately,
even if KVM is indeed a separate module.

If we still have any form of 1G problem (including dma, in the case of
vhost), IMHO the VM still cannot be declared usable over 1G.  This
"optimization" is not solving the problem if not considering the rest.

So if we're going to propose the new solution to replace userfault, I'd
rather we add support separately for everything at least still public, even
if it'll take more work, comparing to make it kvm-only.

Userfaults rely on the temp buffer.  Take UFFDIO_COPY as an example,
uffdio_copy.src|len describes that. Then the kernel does the atomicity
work.

I'm not sure why KVM-based doesn't have that problem.  IIUC it'll be the
same?  We can't make the folio present in the gmemfd mapping if it doesn't
yet contain full data copied over.  Having a special flag for the mapping
is fine for each folio to allow different access permissions looks also
fine, but that sounds like over complicated to me.

Thanks,
