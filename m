How about adding an entry in vmx_get_msr() for
MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES and check pmu_version? This basically pairs
with the implementation in vmx_set_msr() for MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES.

Doing so allows KVM_GET_MSRS return 0 for the MSR instead of returning
the initial permitted value.

The benefit is that it is not enforcing the VMM to explicitly set the
value. In fact, there are several platform MSRs which has initial value
that VMM may rely on instead of explicitly setting.
MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES is only one of them.
