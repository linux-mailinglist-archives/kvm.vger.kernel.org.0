VFIO_PLATFORM only is compiled on ARM today but that's probably not the
main issue here. I don't know if the fact the platform devices you want
to assign are behind this PCI I2C controller does change anything in the
way we would bind the devices to vfio-platform.

Up to now, in QEMU we have only generated DT bindings for the assigned
platform devices. Generating AML code has never been experienced.

What I don't get in your existing POC is how your enumerate the platform
devices resources (regs, IRQs) behing your controller. I understand you
devised a solution to expose the specific IRQ but what about regs? How
are they presented to your guest?

Thanks

Eric
