It's not, but given how little love 32-bit KVM receives, I prefer to 
stick to the subset of the ABI that is "equivalent" to 64-bit.

Same reasoning (no one cares about 32-bits), different conclusions...

Not just for that, but especially to avoid making 
msr_write_intercepted() noinstr.

Yeah, there could be three reasons to have parameters in assembly:

* you just need them (@svm)

* it's too much of a pain to compute it in assembly 
(@spec_ctrl_intercepted, @hsave_pa)

* it needs to be computed outside the clgi/stgi region (not happening 
here, only mentioned for completeness)

As this patch shows, @vmcb is not much of a pain to compute in assembly: 
it is just two instructions, and not passing it in simplifies register 
allocation (the weird push/pop goes away) because all the arguments 
except @svm/_ASM_ARG1 are needed only after vmexit.

Right, in fact that's not the reason why it's passed in---it's just to 
avoid coding page_to_pfn() in assembly, and to limit the differences 
between the regular and SEV-ES cases.  But using a per-CPU variable is 
fine (either in addition to the struct page, which "wastes" 8 bytes per 
CPU, or as a replacement).

I would still place it in struct svm_cpu_data itself, I'll see how it 
looks and possibly post v3.
