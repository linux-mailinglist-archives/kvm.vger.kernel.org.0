Tom Lendacky, could you take a look down in the message to the talk of
SEV?  I want to make sure I'm not misrepresenting what it does today.

Well, by the time they get here, they would have already had to allocate
and set up the encryption key.  I don't think this would really be the
"normal" malloc() path, for instance.

If our interface to MKTME is:

	fd = open("/dev/mktme");
	ptr = mmap(fd);

Then it's hard to combine with an interface which is:

	fd = open("/dev/dax123");
	ptr = mmap(fd);

Where if we have something like mprotect() (or madvise() or something
else taking pointer), we can just do:

	fd = open("/dev/anything987");
	ptr = mmap(fd);
	sys_encrypt(ptr);

Now, we might not *do* it that way for dax, for instance, but I'm just
saying that if we go the /dev/mktme route, we never get a choice.

I think you're drawing the line at pages where the kernel can manage
contents vs. not manage contents.  I'm not sure that's the right
distinction to make, though.  The thing that is important is whether the
kernel can manage the lifetime and location of the data in the page.

Basically: Can the kernel choose where the page comes from and get the
page back when it wants?

I really don't like the current state of things like with SEV or with
KVM direct device assignment where the physical location is quite locked
down and the kernel really can't manage the memory.  I'm trying really
hard to make sure future hardware is more permissive about such things.
 My hope is that these are a temporary blip and not the new normal.

Kai Huang (who is on cc) has been doing the QEMU enabling and might want
to weigh in.  I'd also love to hear from the AMD folks in case I'm not
grokking some aspect of SEV.

But, my understanding is that, even today, neither QEMU nor the kernel
can see SEV-encrypted guest memory.  So QEMU should already understand
how to not interact with guest memory.  I _assume_ it's also already
doing this with anonymous memory, without needing /dev/sme or something.

I'm not following here.  XPFO just means that we don't keep the direct
map around all the time for all memory.  If XPFO and
MKTME-as-anonymous-memory were both in play, I think we'd just be
creating/destroying the MKTME-enlightened direct map instead of a
vanilla one.
