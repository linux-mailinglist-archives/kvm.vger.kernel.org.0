Duh, I never CC'd the new list... Now hopefully done.

A different L2 table, surely? By definition, we only have a single L1
table.

Just to make it clear, do you mean this:

diff --git a/arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-its.c b/arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-its.c
index 9d3299a70242..e722cafdff60 100644

+++ b/arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-its.c
@@ -2162,6 +2162,9 @@ static int scan_its_table(struct vgic_its *its, gpa_t base, int size, u32 esz,

 		id += next_offset;

If so, then I agree that this is a sensible fix. EricR, do you mind
respinning this ASAP so that I can get it merged and backported?

Thanks,
