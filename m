Fair enough, on vIRQ hardirq handler the physical IRQ gets unmasked.
This event occurs on guest EOI, which triggers the resamplefd. But what
is the state of the vIRQ? Isn't it stil masked until the vIRQ thread
completes, preventing the physical IRQ from being propagated to the guest?

Before going further and we invest more time in that thread, please
could you give us additional context info and confidence
in/understanding of the stakes. This thread is from Jan 2021 and was
discontinued for a while. vfio-platform currently only is enabled on ARM
and maintained for very few devices which properly implement reset
callbacks and duly use an underlying IOMMU.

Thanks
