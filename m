yes, I know

I found out that my mailbox software filtered out the other two patches, 
which led me to look at the patch alone, so it was weird. I already got 
the answer now.

Yes, in addition to that, if a vPE is scheduled out of the PE, the cache 
clearing and write-back to VPT are also performed, I think.


However, I feel a litter confusing to read this comment at first ,Â  
because it is not only VMAPP that causes cache clearing.

I don't know why VMAPP was mentioned here until I check the other two 
patches ("KVM: arm64: GICv4.1: Try to save hw pending state in 
save_pending_tables").


So I think may be it's better to add some background description here.


Thanks
