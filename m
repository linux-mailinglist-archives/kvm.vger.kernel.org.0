I'd expect to include the 32 bit window too..

All drivers have this issue to one degree or another. We seem to be
ignoring it - in any case this is a micro optimization, not a
functional need?

The basic API is very simple - the driver needs to provide ranges of
IOVA and map/unmap - I don't think we have a future problem here we
need to try and guess and solve today.

Even PPC fits this just fine, the open question for DPDK is more
around optimization, not functional.

No, this just makes it fragile in the other direction because now
userspace has to know what platform specific things to ask for *or it
doesn't work at all*. This is not a improvement for the DPDK cases.

Kernel decides, using all the kernel knowledge it has and tells the
application what it can do - this is the basic simplified interface.

I wouldn't say n^2, but yes, qemu needs to have a userspace driver for
the platform IOMMU, and yes it needs this to reach optimal
behavior. We already know this is a hard requirement for using nesting
as acceleration, I don't see why apertures are so different.

As above, if you ask for the wrong thing then you don't get
anything. If DPDK asks for something that works on ARM like 0 -> 4G
then PPC and x86 will always fail. How is this improving anything to
require applications to carefully ask for exactly the right platform
specific ranges?

It isn't like there is some hard coded value we can put into DPDK that
will work on every platform. So kernel must pick for DPDK, IMHO. I
don't see any feasible alternative.

We've talked about a size of IOVA address space before, strictly as a
hint, to possible optimize page table layout, or something, and I'm
fine with that idea. But - we have no driver implementation today, so
I'm not sure what we can really do with this right now..

Kevin could Intel consume a hint on IOVA space and optimize the number
of IO page table levels?

The ppc specific driver would be on the generic side of qemu in its
viommu support framework. There is lots of host driver optimization
possible here with knowledge of the underlying host iommu HW. It
should not be connected to the qemu target.

It is not so different from today where qemu has to know about ppc's
special vfio interface generically even to emulate x86.

It is part of the generic qemu iommu interface layer. For nesting qemu
would copy the guest page table format to the host page table format
in userspace and trigger invalidation - no pinning, no kernel
map/unmap calls. It can only be done with detailed knowledge of the
host iommu since the host iommu io page table format is exposed
directly to userspace.

In the iommu core it handled the io holes and things through the group
reserved IOVA list - there isn't actualy a limit in the iommu_domain,
it has a flat pagetable format - and in cases like PASID/SVA the group
reserved list doesn't apply at all.

This is the device-specific iommu_domain creation path. The domain can
have information defining its aperture.

Which is why the current scheme is fully automatic and we rely on the
iommu driver to automatically select something sane for DPDK/etc
today.

Yes, DPDK does assume there is some fairly large available aperture,
that should be the driver default behavior, IMHO.

Again, as above, it breaks portability because apps have no hope to
