No, I only happened upon this series looking at lore. My problem is that
none of the affected maintainers or reviewers were cc'ed on the series.

I think there may be a slight disconnect here :) I'm in no way encouraging
off-list discussion and instead asking that mail on the list arrives in
the right folks' inboxes.

Posting an RFC on the list was absolutely the right thing to do.
