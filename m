This is a poor name.  The constraint comes from the RMP, not TDP, and technically
speaking applies to all forms of paging.  It just happens to be relevant only to
TDP because NPT is required for SNP.  And KVM already incorporates the max TDP
level in kvm_configure_mmu().

Regarding the params, I'd much prefer to have this take "struct kvm *kvm" instead
of the vCPU.  It obviously doesn't change the functionality in any way, but I'd
like it to be clear to readers that the adjustment is tied to the VM, not the vCPU.

I think I'd also vote to drop @max_level and make this a pure constraint input as
opposed to an adjuster.

Another option would be to drop the kvm_x86_ops hooks entirely and call
snp_lookup_page_in_rmptable() directly from MMU code.  That would require tracking
that a VM is SNP-enabled in arch code, but I'm pretty sure info has already bled
into common KVM in one form or another.

This is completely bogus, nonpaging_page_fault() is used iff TDP is disabled.

This is unnecessary.  The max mapping level is computed by factoring in all
constraints, of which there are many.  In this case, KVM is consulting the guest's
MTRR configuration to avoid creating a page that spans different memtypes (because
the guest MTRRs are effectively represented in the TDP PTE).  SNP's RMP constraints
have no relevance to the MTRR constraint, or any other constraint for that matter.

TL;DR: the RMP constraint belong in kvm_mmu_max_mapping_level() and nowhere else.
I would go so far as to argue it belong in host_pfn_mapping_level(), after the
call to lookup_address_in_mm().

I can't tell if this check is correct.  Per the APM:

  When SEV-SNP is enabled globally, the processor places restrictions on all memory
  accesses based on the contents of the RMP, whether the accesses are performed by
  the hypervisor, a legacy guest VM, a non-SNP guest VM or an SNP-active guest VM.
  The processor may perform one or more of the following checks depending on the
  context of the access:

  ...

  Page-Size: Checks that the following conditions are met:
    - If the nested page table indicates a 2MB or 1GB page size, the Page_Size field
      of the RMP entry of the target page is 1.
    - If the nested page table indicates a 4KB page size, the Page_Size field of the
      RMP entry of the target page is 0.

The Page-Size bullet does not have any qualifiers about the NPT checks applying
only to SNP guests.  The Hypervisor-Owned bullet implies that unassigned pages
do not need to have identical sizes, but it's not clear whether or not so called
"Hypervisor-Owned" pages override the nested page tables.

Table 15.36 is similarly vague:

  Assigned Flag indicating that the system physical page is assigned to a guest
  or to the AMD-SP.
    0: Owned by the hypervisor
    1: Owned by a guest or the AMD-SP

My assumption is that all of the "guest owned" stuff really means "SNP guest owned",
e.g. section 15.36.5 says "The hypervisor manages the SEV-SNP security attributes of
pages assigned to SNP-active guests by altering the RMP entries of those pages", but
that's not at all clear throughout most of the RMP documentation.

Regardless of the actual behavior, the APM needs serious cleanup on the aforementioned
sections.  E.g. as written, the "processor may perform one or more of the following
checks depending on the context of the access" verbiage basically gives the CPU carte
blanche to do whatever the hell it wants.

Assuming pfn is backed by struct page is broken, at least given the existing
call sites..  It might hold true that only struct page pfns are covered by the
RMP, but assuming pfn_to_page() will return a valid pointer here is completely
wrong.  Unless I'm missing something, taking a struct page anywhere in the RMP
helpers is at best sketchy and at worst broken in and of itself.  IMO, the RMP
code should always take a raw PFN and do the necessary checks before assuming
anything about the PFN.  At a glance, the only case that needs additional checks
is the page_to_virt() logic in rmpupdate().

As the APM is currently worded, this is wrong, and the whole "tdp_max_page_level"
name is wrong.  As noted above, the Page-Size bullet points states that 2mb/1gb
pages in the NPT _must_ have RMP.page_size=1, and 4kb pages in the NPT _must_
have RMP.page_size=0.  That means that the RMP adjustment is not a constraint,
it's an exact requirement.  Specifically, if the RMP is a 2mb page then KVM must
install a 2mb (or 1gb) page.  Maybe it works because KVM will PSMASH the RMP
after installing a bogus 4kb NPT and taking an RMP violation, but that's a very
convoluted and sub-optimal solution.

That other obvious bug is that this doesn't play nice with 1gb pages.  A 2mb RMP
entry should _not_ force KVM to use a 2mb page instead of a 1gb page.
