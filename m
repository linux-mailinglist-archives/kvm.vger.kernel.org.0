I'm OK with that. Just thought that keeping a sysbus_realize_simple 
function that's the same as sysbus_create simple minus creating the device 
would not be a big change and cause less churn. But if you plan te remove 
this completely in near future so another API would be needed anyway then 
maybe not worth keeping it. Having only low level functions to create and 
wire devices seems impractical for writing boeards in C so eventually some 
replacement will be needed. I doubt every board can be quickly converted 
to a new declarative way soon but you can prove me wrong. If this helps 
you to progress to that direction then I'm not attached to it to much but 
would like to keep some simplicity in board code wherever possible as it's 
already quite complex to do simple things with low level APIs so I'd 
prefer if convenience APIs don't go away.
