Dear Devs,

i was able to trace two of the segfaults
with the trace-cmd as describes on the KVM bug reporting website.

As I can not attach those big files here are the links to the files:

https://share.ziegi.de/compile_switch_wlan_on_segfault-1.txt.gz
https://share.ziegi.de/compile_switch_wlan_on_segfault-2.txt.gz

It would be great if someone could give me a feedback
on this, or direct me to where to post my question if this is not the right
place for it.

Thanks,
Torsten
