Let me explain my thoughts about this again, now that I hopefully
understand this correctly:

L1 register state is stored in VMCB01 since the CPU stores it there,
every time L1 VMexits.

Now L1 is a host for L2, and therefore this is also L1 "host" state.

When we switch to L2, it is therefore natural to keep that state in
vmcb01, and not copy it to VM_HSAVE_PA area.

So when running SMM code in L1, since we must not corrupt this state,
It makes sense to back it up somewhere,
but as I said I prefer to store/migrate it out of band instead of
saving it in the guest memory, although Paolo's reasoning that CPU
might *sometimes* write VM_HSAVE_PA and that *sometimes* is allowed to be
when we enter SMM,  does make sense.
Thus I don't have a strong opinion on this anymore, as long as it works.

Something else to note, just for our information is that KVM 
these days does vmsave/vmload to VM_HSAVE_PA to store/restore 
the additional host state, something that is frowned upon in the spec, 
but there is some justification of doing this in the commit message,
citing an old spec which allowed this.
This shoudn't affect anything, but just FYI.
