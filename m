Urgh... I guess this is the time to set some ground rules:

- Please don't introduce dependencies between series, that's
  unmanageable. I really need to see each series independently, and if
  there is a merge conflict, that's my job to fix (and I don't really
  mind).

- If there is a dependency between series, please post a version of
  the required patches as a prefix to your series, assuming this
  prefix is itself standalone. If it isn't, then something really is
  wrong, and the series should be resplit.

- You also should be basing your series on an *official* tag from
  Linus' tree (preferably -rc1, -rc2 or -rc3), and not something
  random like any odd commit from the KVM tree (I had conflicts while
  applying this on -rc3, probably due to the non-advertised dependency
  on Oliver's series).

I've picked the two patches, which means they will most likely appear
twice in the history. In the future, please reach out so that we can
organise this better.

Dumped a one-liner there.

Ah, rebasing leftovers, now gone.

I've pushed an updated branch again, please have a look.
