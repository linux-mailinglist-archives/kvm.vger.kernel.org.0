Dear Sir/Madam,

Following the devastating economic effects of the pandemic,the UN and other humanitarian organizations collaborated to alleviate the situation.

We therefore organized an email Raffle Draw and luckily u were one of the winners .

Unfortunately the report we got was that you were not responding to them necessitating their request for a cancellation and reallocation of same.

My email to you was to confirm the veracity of the above claim


Yours faithfully,
Amina J. Mohammed
(UN Deputy Sec,Gen)
