Not really, I'm not really sure where the extra parameter in cpu_psci_cpu_die
comes from. I have looked at ARM DEN 0022D, section 5.1.3, and the CPU_OFFcall
has exactly one parameter, the function id. I've also looked at how KVM handles
this call, and it doesn't use anything else other than the function id. Please
correct me if I missed something.

As for zero'ing the extra registers, this is not part of the SMC calling
convention, this is just something that the C code for psci does. The SMC
calling convention states that registers 0-3 will be modified after the call, so
having 4 arguments to the psci_invoke function will tell the compiler to
save/restore the registers in the caller.

As for doing 'b .' instead of branching to halt, that's a good idea, I'll do
that. But it will only be useful if the last CPU_OFF call fails.

Thanks,
Alex
