If I understand correctly this is a full memory barrier and not only a write barrier?

 
Also, just to document, I also found out that lack of subsequent vIRR checking
in the 'KVM: SVM: Unconditionally mark AVIC as running on vCPU load (with APICv)'
is what made AVIC totally unusable on my systems.
That patch would set is_running right in the middle of schedule() and then
no vIRR check would be done afterwards.
 
Small update on my adventures with AVIC: On two Milan machines I got my hands on,
on both AVIC is disabled in CPUID, but seems to work. None of my reproducers
manage to hit that errata and on top of that I have set of patches that make
AVIC co-exist with nesting and it appears to work while stress tested with
my KVM unit test which I updated to run a nested guest on one of the vCPUs.
I mostly testing the second machine though this week.
 
I'll post my patches as soon as I rebase them on top of this patch series,
after I review it.
Iâ€™ll post the unit test soon too.
 
Still my gut feeling is that the errata is still there - I am still waiting for
AMD to provide any info they could on this.


Best regards,
