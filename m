Sir

There is business I have been planning to figure out in your country
and I wanted to be sure about it before I go into details. We have a
means to make money, how about we establishment a company; it will be
about sales and lease of heavy duty equipments to Construction
companies or any other investment guideline from you? I know getting a
business license takes time and costs a lot, so you will just have to
go to the local county office to get a DBA certificate (Doing Business
As). It is also called fictitious name or Assumption name.

Then you will take the certificate to the bank to open a business
checking account. We (me and project manager) already designed proper
plans, you will be in charge of finances and we will be in charge of
operations. We will bid for contracts through my ministry where I head
as chairman of the board, once I present you as a contractor, they
will make payments into our account through a foreign project manager
of the ministry.

You will receive the payment and then take your share and remit my
share to any vendors I will provide to you. Contracts are worth
millions, they can pay at once or bit by bit. Let me know what you
think. If you are cool with it, then you'll need to talk to the
project manager where this payment will be made to you as soon as I
secure a contract amount on your behalf.

I await your immediate response.

Sincerely Yours,

Mr. Hayford A. Settor
