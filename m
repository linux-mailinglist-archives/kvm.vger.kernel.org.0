Perhaps vmx_set_nested_state() can set dirty_vmcs12 right before the 
consistency checks are done ? I see no difference in correctness. Also, 
it calls set_current_vmptr() which anyway sets dirty_vmcs12 for valid VMCSs.

Initially, I was thinking of inserting the check for dirty_vmcs12 right 
in place of each of the checks without having to move them to separate 
functions. That approach saves the separation of the checks but results 
in poor readability. Hence I adopted the current approach.

Are you referring to the categorization done in 
copy_vmcs12_to_enlightened() ? If so, what is the basis for 
categorization in there ?
We can re-order the checks in 
nested_vmx_check_{controls,host_state,guest_state} based on dirty_vmcsÂ  
to create an initial framework for controlling the consistency checks. 
The only disadvantage will be that such an ordering will be completely 
off from how the SDM describes the checks.

It seems you are suggesting a finer granularity up to each VMCS field 
instead of groups of VMCS fields ? Then we need a per-field flag to 
track its modification and that seems an overkill.
