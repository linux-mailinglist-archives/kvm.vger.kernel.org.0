Ok, I will.

Thanks, interesting point. Do you mean that this behavior (a new vIRQ as
a result of polarity change) may already happen with the existing KVM code?

It doesn't seem so to me. AFAICT, KVM completely ignores the vIOAPIC
polarity bit, in particular it doesn't handle change of the polarity by
the guest (i.e. doesn't update the virtual IRR register, and so on), so
it shouldn't result in a new interrupt.

Since commit 100943c54e09 ("kvm: x86: ignore ioapic polarity") there
seems to be an assumption that KVM interpretes the IRQ level value as
active (asserted) vs inactive (deasserted) rather than high vs low, i.e.
the polarity doesn't matter to KVM.

So, since both sides (KVM emulating the IOAPIC, and vfio/whatever
emulating an external interrupt source) seem to operate on a level of
abstraction of "asserted" vs "de-asserted" interrupt state regardless of
the polarity, and that seems not a bug but a feature, it seems that we
don't need to emulate the IRQ level as such. Or am I missing something?

OTOH, I guess this means that the existing KVM's emulation of
level-triggered interrupts is somewhat limited (a guest may legitimately
expect an interrupt fired as a result of polarity change, and that case
is not supported by KVM). But that is rather out of scope of the oneshot
interrupts issue addressed by this patchset.
