The key word is *device*. No vcpu is involved here. Actually, we
actively prevent save/restore of the ITS while vcpus are running. How
could you even expect to snapshot a consistent state if the interrupt
state is changing under your feet?

I can't see how that can result in a bad state for KVM itself. All you
lack is a way for userspace to *track* the dirtying. Just like we
don't have a way to track the dirtying of a page from the VMM.

Yup, and that's a luser error. Too bad. Userspace can still transfer
all the memory, and all will be fine.

Again, user error. Userspace can readily write over all the guest
memory (virtio), and no amount of KVM-side tracking will help. What
are you going to do about it?

At the end of the day, what are you trying to do? All the dirty
tracking muck (bitmap and ring) is only a way for userspace to track
dirty pages more easily and accelerate the transfer. If userspace
doesn't tell KVM to track these writes, tough luck. If the author of a
VMM doesn't understand that, then maybe they shouldn't be in charge of
the VMM. Worse case, they can still transfer the whole thing, no harm
done.

Can we please stop the exit nonsense? There is no vcpu involved
here. This is a device (emulated or not) writing to memory, triggered
by an ioctl from userspace. If you're thinking vcpu, you have the
wrong end of the stick.

Memory gets dirtied system wide, not just by CPUs, and no amount of
per-vcpu resource is going to solve this problem. VM-based rings can
help with if they provide a way to recover from an overflow. But that
obviously doesn't work here as we can't checkpoint and restart the
saving process on overflow.
