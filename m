Yes. The firmware page means that x86 cannot write to it; the read is 
still allowed.

The firmware supports all the commands listed in the spec. The HV 
support is always going to be behind what a firmware or hardware is 
capable of doing. As per the spec is concerned, it say

   The firmware checks that MSG_TYPE is a valid message type. The
   firmware then checks that MSG_SIZE is large enough to hold the
   indicated message type at the indicated message version. If
   not, the firmware returns INVALID_PARAM.

So, a hypervisor could potentially send the INVALID_PARAMS to indicate 
that guest that a message type is not supported.

In my single VM, I am seeing latency of guest request to be around ~35ms.

Correct.

I believe the thought process was by providing 4 keys it can provide 
flexibility for each VMPL levels to use a different keys (if they wish). 
The firmware does not care about the vmpl level during the guest request 
handling, it just want to know which key is used for encrypting the 
payload so that he can decrypt and provide the  response for it.

Yes, KVM should not rely on it. I mentioned that mainly because you said 
that guest must implement its own serialization. In the case of KVM, the 
CCP driver ensure that the command sent to the PSP is serialized.
