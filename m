Hi Kirti,

Sorry to disturb you since this patch set has been merged, and I cannot
receive the qemu-side emails about this patch set.

We are going to support migration for VFIO devices which support dirty
pages tracking.

And we also plan to leverage SMMU HTTU feature to do the dirty pages
tracking for the devices which don't support dirty pages tracking.

For the above two cases, which side determines to choose IOMMU driver or
vendor driver to do dirty bitmap tracking, Qemu or VFIO?

In brief, if both IOMMU and VFIO devices support dirty pages tracking,
we can check the capability and prefer to track dirty pages on device
vendor driver which is more efficient.

The qusetion is which side to do the check and selection? In my opinion,
Qemu/userspace seems more suitable.
