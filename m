THIS IS MY HUSBAND WISH
MY NAME IS Mrs. Maya Oliver,
My Name is Mrs. Maya Oliver, from Norway. I know that this message
will be a surprise to you. Firstly, I am married to Mr. Patrick
Oliver, A diamond and gold merchant who owns a small gold Mine in
Burkina Faso and Egypt Cairo; He died of Cardiovascular Disease in
mid-March 2011. During his lifetime he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 18.5
Million Euro) Eighteen million, Five hundred thousand Euros in a bank
in Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso. The deposited money
was from the sale of the shares, death benefits payment and
entitlements of my deceased husband by his company.
Please reply to my privet mail after reading: mrs.mayaolivia90@gmail.com

I am sending this message to you praying that it will reach you in
good health, since I am not in good health in which I sleep every
night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am
suffering from long term cancer and presently I am partially suffering
from a stroke illness which has become almost impossible for me to
move around. I was married to my late husband for over 4 years before
he died and unfortunately that we don't have a child, my doctor
confided in me that i have less chance to live. Having known my health
condition, I decided to contact you to claim the fund since I don't
have any relation. I grew up in an orphanage.

I have decided to donate what I have to you for the support of helping
Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and
diagnosed with cancer about 2 years ago. I have been touched by God
Almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to
you for the good work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to
forgive me and believe he has, because He is a Merciful God I will be
going in for an operation soon.

This is the reason I need your services to stand as my next of kin or
an executor to claim the funds for charity purposes. If this money
remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the
government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for
selfish and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can
claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows
and also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my
late husband and my name; I need your urgent answer to know if you
will be able to execute this project, and I will give you more
information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account
from the  Burkina Faso bank.

Thanks
Mrs. Maya
