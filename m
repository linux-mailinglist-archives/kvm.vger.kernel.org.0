The tip tree preferred format for patch subject prefixes is
'subsys/component:', e.g. 'x86/apic:', 'x86/mm/fault:', 'sched/fair:',
'genirq/core:'. Please do not use file names or complete file paths as
prefix. 'git log path/to/file' should give you a reasonable hint in most
cases.

The condensed patch description in the subject line should start with a
uppercase letter and should be written in imperative tone.

In this case:

x86/head/64: Re-enable stack protection

There's no need for 32/64-bit builds - we don't have anything else :-)

Please check all your subjects.

Function names need to end with "()" so that it is clear they're
functions.

Add here somewhere:

"See

  3fb0fdb3bbe7 ("x86/stackprotector/32: Make the canary into a regular percpu variable")

for details."

Do you mean this:

SYM_DATA(initial_gs,    .quad INIT_PER_CPU_VAR(fixed_percpu_data))

Can't you simply do

	movq    sme_me_mask, %rax

here instead and avoid the issue altogether?
