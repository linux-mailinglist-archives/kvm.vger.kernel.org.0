Subject: [PULL v9 09/13] confidential guest support: Update documentation

Now that we've implemented a generic machine option for configuring various
confidential guest support mechanisms:
  1. Update docs/amd-memory-encryption.txt to reference this rather than
     the earlier SEV specific option
  2. Add a docs/confidential-guest-support.txt to cover the generalities of
     the confidential guest support scheme

+Confidential Guest Support
+==========================
+
+Traditionally, hypervisors such as QEMU have complete access to a
+guest's memory and other state, meaning that a compromised hypervisor
+can compromise any of its guests.  A number of platforms have added
+mechanisms in hardware and/or firmware which give guests at least some
+protection from a compromised hypervisor.  This is obviously
+especially desirable for public cloud environments.
+
+These mechanisms have different names and different modes of
+operation, but are often referred to as Secure Guests or Confidential
+Guests.  We use the term "Confidential Guest Support" to distinguish
+this from other aspects of guest security (such as security against
+attacks from other guests, or from network sources).
+
+Running a Confidential Guest
+----------------------------
+
+To run a confidential guest you need to add two command line parameters:
+
+1. Use "-object" to create a "confidential guest support" object.  The
+   type and parameters will vary with the specific mechanism to be
+   used
+2. Set the "confidential-guest-support" machine parameter to the ID of
+   the object from (1).
+
+Example (for AMD SEV)::
+
+    qemu-system-x86_64 \
+        <other parameters> \
+        -machine ...,confidential-guest-support=sev0 \
+        -object sev-guest,id=sev0,cbitpos=47,reduced-phys-bits=1
+
+Supported mechanisms
+--------------------
+
+Currently supported confidential guest mechanisms are:
+
+AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)
+    docs/amd-memory-encryption.txt
+
+Other mechanisms may be supported in future.
