There is no such architectural requirement.

I can't see anything else that guarantee that the caches are clean,
and that there is no possible write to the PE table.

Well, relying on the standard irqchip state methods to peek at the
pending state isn't very reliable, as you could be temped to call into
this even when the VPE is mapped. Which is why I've suggested
a different implementation.
