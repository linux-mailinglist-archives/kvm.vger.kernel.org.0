A bit of flag can be found so far though the space is somehow nervous. 
What I
am worrying about is, we introduce a flag per thread and add the check 
in core
place like softirq path and context switch path, to handle a case only 
for KVM
thread + XFD=1 + AMX usage in guest. This is not a quite frequent case 
but we
need check every time for every thread.

I am considering using XGETBV(1) (~24 cycles) to detect if KVM really need
wrmsr(0) to clear XFD for guest AMX state when vmexit. And this is not a 
quite
frequent case I think. Only one concern is, does/will kernel check 
somewhere that
thread's memory fpu buffer is already large but thread's XFD=1? (I 
believe not)

Thanks,
Jing
