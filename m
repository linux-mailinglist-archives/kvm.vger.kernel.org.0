We modified unittest to make AP runing with idle loop instead of hlt . 
This eliminates the impact
from adaptive halt-polling. So far we don't observe the influence from 
adaptive advance lapic timer
by test either. vmexit/ipi test should not involve lapic timer.

We post the hackbench and ipi microbenchmark score in patch V2 for your 
reference.

Thanks.
