Dear Beloved One,

CHARITY DONATION Please read carefully, I know it is true that this
letter may come to you as a surprise. I came across your e-mail
contact through a private search while in need of your assistance. I
am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart, I have
chose to reach you through Internet because it still remains the
fastest medium of communication.

My Name is Mrs. Theresa Heidi I am native France currently
hospitalized in a private hospital here in Israel as a result of lungs
cancer I am 62 years old and I was diagnosed of lungs cancer for about
4 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband, who has left
me everything he worked for. I'm with my laptop in a hospital here in
where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. I have
some funds inherited from my late husband, the sum of Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars Only (USD$2,500,000,00).Now it's clear that
I=E2=80=99m approaching the last-days of my life and I don't think I need t=
his
money anymore. My doctor made me to understand that I would not last
for the period of one year due to Lungs cancer problem.

This money is still with the foreign bank and the management wrote me
as the true owner to come forward to receive the money or rather issue
a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since
I can't come over because of my illness. Failure to act the bank may
get fund confiscated for keeping it so long.

I decided to contact you if you maybe willing and interested to help
me withdraw this money from the foreign bank then use the funds for
Charity works in helping the less privileged and also to fight against
Covid-19 Pandemic in the society. I want you to handle these trust
funds in good faith before anything happens to me. This is not a
stolen money and there are no dangers involved is 100% risk free with
full legal proof.

I want you to take 45% of the total money for your personal used while
55% of the money will go to charity work. I will appreciate your
utmost trust and confidentiality in this matter to accomplish my heart
desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish. I
am very sorry if you received this letter in your spam, is due to
recent connection error here in the country.

Yours Beloved Sister.
Mrs. Theresa Heidi
