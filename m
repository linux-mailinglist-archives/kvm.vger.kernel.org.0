Thank you Peter and Paolo!

In this version, I referenced host kernel settings when expose 
X86_KERNEL_IBT to guest.

The reason would be _IF_ host, for whatever reason, disabled the IBT 
feature, exposing the

feature blindly to guest could be risking, e.g., hitting some issues 
host wants to mitigate.

The actual implementation depends on the agreement we got :-)

Exactly, the CPUID enumeration could be a pain point for the KVM solution.

It makes {U,S}_CET feature control harder for guest.

KVM has problem advertising S_SS alone to guest whenÂ  U_CET(both SS and 
IBT) are

not available to guest. I would like to hear the voice from community on 
how to

make the features control straightforward and reasonable. Existing CPUID 
enumeration

cannot advertise {U, S}_SS and {U,S}_IBT well.
