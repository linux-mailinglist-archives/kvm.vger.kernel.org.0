There is no need for an extra cast. kern_hyp_va() already provides a
cast to the type of the parameter.

Do we really need to go through this is_aarch32_allowed check?
Protected VMs don't have AArch32, and we don't have the infrastructure
to handle 32bit at all. For non-protected VMs, we already have what we
need at EL1. So the extra check only adds complexity.
