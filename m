Yes, the control API and algorithm to deal with the problem needs to
have standardization, but the data passed in/out of the APIs can vary.

Essentially the key is that vendors should be able to create devices
at the kernel, and those devices should "just work" with the existing
generic userspace migration / compat checking code, without needing
extra vendor specific logic to be added.

Note, I'm not saying that the userspace decisions would be perfectly
optimal based on generic code. They might be making a simplified
decision that while functionally safe, is not the ideal solution.
Adding vendor specific code might be able to optimize the userspace
decisions, but that should be considered just optimization, not a
core must have for any opertion.

Daniel
