My point is that performance numbers on such an ancient kernel hardly
make any sense, as a large portion of the code will be different. We
aim to live in the future, not in the past.

So this is not a self contained benchmark, that on top of it requires
some vague additional changes. Great.

Exactly. I also contend that *no* operating system uses broadcast (or
even multicast) signalling, because this is a very pointless
operation.

So what are you optimising for?

Then what's the point of your patch? You don't explain anything, which
makes it very hard to guess what you're aiming for.

      M.
