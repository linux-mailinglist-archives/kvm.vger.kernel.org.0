This series is mostly fixes and cleanups for things I found when playing
with EFI support. Most of them I hope are fairly self-explanatory.

What is clearly aimed at running on baremetal is patch #2 ("arm/arm64:
Remove dcache_line_size global variable"), which is needed because the
startup environment is different for EFI apps and we're going to need to do
cache maintenance before setup() is run.

Patch #4 ("lib: arm64: Consolidate register definitions to sysreg.h") is
there to make importing register definitions and other header files from
Linux (like el2_setup.h) easier by switching to the same layout. And arm
is already using sysreg.h for SCTLR fields.

Alexandru Elisei (6):
  arm64: Remove unnecessary ISB when writing to SPSel
  arm/arm64: Remove dcache_line_size global variable
  arm/arm64: Remove unnecessary ISB when doing dcache maintenance
  lib: arm64: Consolidate register definitions to sysreg.h
  arm64: Configure SCTLR_EL1 at boot
  arm64: Disable TTBR1_EL1 translation table walks
