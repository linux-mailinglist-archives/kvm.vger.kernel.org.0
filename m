AFAIR the problem is not s390-ccw QEMU bios. We could easily fix that.
The practical problem is some channel programs generated by zipl that
simply fail to set the bit (although they could). That is a perfectly
legit thing to do, because the prefetch bit was originally about
performance.

Sorry I missed your mail, so complained about the same
issues.
