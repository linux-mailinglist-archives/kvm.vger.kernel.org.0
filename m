That's a fair point. However, no existing userspace will work on these
systems. Is that what we want to do? I don't care much, but having
non-usable defaults feel a bit... odd. I do spit out a warning, but I
agree this isn't great either.

I'll make sure to redirect the reports your way! :D

Thanks,
