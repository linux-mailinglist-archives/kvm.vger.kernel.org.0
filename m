Hint, my "Why" was attempting to get you to write a better changelog
description, which would include the above information.  Please read the
kernel documentation for hints on how to do this so that we know what
why changes are being made.

If it chooses not to, what happens?

Why not use the normal virtio console device interface instead of making
a riscv-custom one?

Where is the userspace side of this interface at?  Where are the patches
to handle this new api you added?

So you are sure that userspace never actually tests or sends that _MAX
value anywhere?  If not, why is it even needed?
