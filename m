Hi Sean, Boris,

Thanks for all  your feedback.

Sean,

Do you want to send me your patch (so that with your SoB), or do you want me to copy
& paste the code you posted in this series, plus Suggested-by you? Or how do you want
to proceed?

Also to me it is better to separate X86_FEATURE_SGX1/2 with rest of KVM changes?

And do you think adding a dedicated, i.e. kvm_scattered_cpu_caps[], instead of using
existing kvm_cpu_cap[NCAPINTS] would be helpful to solve the problem caused by adding
new leaf to x86 core (see my another reply in this thread)?
