First of all,

let me give you a very important piece of advice for the future:
ignoring review feedback is a very unfriendly thing to do:

- if you agree with the feedback, you work it in in the next revision

- if you don't agree, you *say* *why* you don't

What you should avoid is what you've done - ignore it silently. Because
reviewing submitters code is the most ungrateful work around the kernel,
and, at the same time, it is the most important one.

So please make sure you don't do that in the future when submitting
patches for upstream inclusion. I'm sure you can imagine, the ignoring
can go both ways.

There's no such potential: binutils encodes the unstruction operands
and what types are allowed. IOW, the assembler knows that there goes a
register.

I guess in this particular case it won't matter whether it is "=r" or
"=g" but still...

Well, my suggestion was to put it *all* in the subleaf struct - not just
the regs:

struct cpuid_leaf {
	u32 func;
	u32 subfunc;
	u32 eax;
	u32 ebx;
	u32 ecx;
	u32 edx;
};

so that the call signature is:

	snp_cpuid_postprocess(struct cpuid_leaf *leaf)

maybe it should read differently *on* *purpose*. Exactly because this is
*not* the usual CPUID handling code but CPUID verification code for SNP
guests.

And please explain to me what's so unclear about leaf->eax vs *eax?!

Having a struct which is properly named will actually be beneficial in
this case:

	hv_leaf->eax

or even

	hv_reported_leaf->eax

vs

	*eax

Now guess which is which.

Huh?! I'm sorry but I cannot follow that logic here.

Well, looking at it, the only difference is that the IO is done
over a struct instead of separate pointers. And the diff is pretty
straight-forward.

So no, having a struct cpuid_leaf containing it all is actually better
in this case because you know which is which if you name it properly and
you have a single pointer argument which you pass around - something
which is done all around the kernel.
