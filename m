My point above is that we shouldn't allow the A->B migration the first
place, and fail it as quickly as possible. We don't know what the guest
has observed in terms of GIC capability, and it may not have enabled the
new flavour of SGIs just yet.

It feels odd. It means we have more state than the HW normally has.
I have an alternative proposal, see below.

Well, that is the semantics of the RES0 bit. It applies from both
guest and userspace.

And actually, maybe we can handle that pretty cheaply. If userspace
tries to restore GICD_TYPER2 to a value that isn't what KVM can
offer, we just return an error. Exactly like we do for GICD_IIDR.
Hence the following patch:

diff --git a/virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-mmio-v3.c 
b/virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-mmio-v3.c
index 28b639fd1abc..e72dcc454247 100644
--- a/virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-mmio-v3.c
+++ b/virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-mmio-v3.c
@@ -156,6 +156,7 @@ static int vgic_mmio_uaccess_write_v3_misc(struct 
kvm_vcpu *vcpu,
  	struct vgic_dist *dist = &vcpu->kvm->arch.vgic;

  	switch (addr & 0x0c) {
+	case GICD_TYPER2:
  	case GICD_IIDR:
  		if (val != vgic_mmio_read_v3_misc(vcpu, addr, len))
  			return -EINVAL;

Being a RO register, writing something that isn't compatible with the
possible behaviour of the hypervisor will just return an error.

What do you think?

Thanks a lot!
