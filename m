Absolutely, I know a thorough review is grueling work, and would never
want to give the impression that I don't appreciate it. Was just hoping
to revisit these in the context of v9 since there were some concerning
things in flight WRT the spec handling and I was sort of focused on
getting ahead of those in case they involved firmware/spec changes. But
I realize that's resulted in a waste of your time and I should have at
least provided some indication of where I was with these before your
review. Won't happen again.

Well, there's also sev_cpuid_hv(), which really is sort of a variant of
cpuid()/native_cpuid() helpers that happens to use the GHCB protocol, and
snp_cpuid() gets called at roughly the same callsite in the #VC handler,
so it made sense to me to just stick to a similar signature across all of
them. But no problem implementing it as you suggested, that was just my
reasoning there.

>

It's not that one is unclear, it's just that, in the context of reading
through a function which has a lot of similar/repetitive cases for
various leaves:

  snp_cpuid_hv(fn, subfn, &eax, &ebx2, NULL, NULL) 

  ebx = fixup(ebx2)

seems slightly easier to process to me than:

  snp_cpuid_hv(&leaf_hv)

  leaf->eax = leaf_hv->eax
  leaf->ebx = fixup(leaf_hv->ebx)

because I already have advance indication from the function call that eax
will be overwritten by hv, ebx2 will getting fixed up in subsequent lines,
and ecx/edx will be used as is, and don't need to parse multiple lines to
discern that.

But I know I may very well be biased from staring at the existing
implementation so much, and that maybe your approach would be clearer to
someone looking at the code who isn't as familiar with that pattern.

Ok, will work this in for v10. My plan is to introduce this struct:

  struct cpuid_leaf {
      u32 fn;
      u32 subfn;
      u32 eax;
      u32 ebx;
      u32 ecx;
      u32 edx;
  }

as part of the patch which introduces sev_cpuid_hv():

  x86/sev: Move MSR-based VMGEXITs for CPUID to helper

and then utilize that for the function parameters there, here, and any
other patches in the SNP code involved with fetching/manipulating cpuid
values before returning them to the #VC handler.

Thanks!
