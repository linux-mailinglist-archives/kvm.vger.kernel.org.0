Hm, what's the difference between 'saved' and 'persistent'? That
'saved' devices are not necessarily present?

So mdevctl can potentially interact with any mdev device on the system,
it just has to be instructed by a user or software to do so? I think we
can work with that.

We probably can get some consensus on a file format pretty quickly, I
guess; and I agree that there's probably not enough magic in there to
make future changes painful. So yes, let's try to agree on a format
that various entities can consume.

How likely is a non-systemd system to not have udev? Can we rely on it
for dynamic management? (Any system will likely have _some_ kind of
uevent-consuming handlers, I guess, unless it is a very specialized
system where mdevctl is unlikely to be used at all.)

I don't think mdevctl should care about mdev-to-guest assignments; that
should be done by libvirt, OpenStack, whatever.

It would be nice if a simple .ini style would cover all things, but I'm
not sure whether vfio-ap isn't already a bit awkward to support with
that. I don't mind JSON much, but would like to avoid XML :)
