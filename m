There's this latency test that checks that the latency for a 10ms timer
is not delayed by more than 10ms (after the first 10ms):

	report(test_cval_10msec(info), "latency within 10 ms");

Just to be safe I will just remove the checks for timers firing before
some margin (not even with a special argument).
