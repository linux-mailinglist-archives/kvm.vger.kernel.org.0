This patch aims to optimize the vCPU search algorithm when injecting vSGI.

For example, in a 64-core VM, the CPU topology consists of 4 aff0 groups 
(0-15, 16-31, 32-47, 48-63). When the guest wants to send a SGI to core 
63, in the previous logic, kvm needs to iterate over all vCPUs to 
identify core 63 using the kvm_for_each_vcpu function, and then inject 
the vSGI into it. However, the ICC_SGI* register provides affinity 
routing information, enabling us to bypass the initial three aff0 
groups, starting with the last one. As a result, the iteration times 
will reduced from the number of vCPUs (64 in this case) to 16 or 8 
times(Using a mask to determine the distribution of a target list in 
ICC_SGI* register).

This optimization effect is evident under the following conditions: 1. A 
VM with more than 16 cores. 2. The inject target vCPU is located after 
the 16th core. Therefore, this patch must ensure that the performance 
will not deteriorate when the inject target is aff0 group (core 0-15), 
thatâ€™s the reason why I put these test data in the patch.
