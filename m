Enabling MSIs on the endpoint before they are programmed in the
interrupt controller? I don't think that's a realistic outcome.

There is no architectural ties between the two at all. There is an
optimisation that allows direct injection if you do it in a non
braindead order. Nothing breaks if you don't, you just have wasted
memory, performance, power and area. You're welcome.

If you want to fix VFIO, be my guest. My rambling about the sorry
state of this has been in the kernel for 5 years (ed8703a506a8).

Do you really want to leave access to the MSI BAR to userspace? The
number of ways this can go wrong is mind-boggling. Starting with
having to rebuild the interrupt translation tables on the host side to
follow what the guest does, instead of keeping the two independent.
