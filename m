Oh I completely missed the scheduling path for KVM.
But since vcpu_put and vcpu_load are exported symbols, I wonder what'll
happen when there are calls to these functions from places other
than kvm_sched_in() and kvm_sched_out() ? Just thinking out loud.

I too get less time to completely read through emails and
associated code between my work assignments. :-).
