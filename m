I set up a test case to compare searching using a hashtable verses using 
a list.
I created both a hashtable and a list of 5100 objects. Each structure 
had a single
APQN field. I then randomly searched both the hashtable and the list for
each APQN. The following table contains the result of 5 test runs. The 
elapsed
times are in nanoseconds.

times faster
Total Search 5500 Avg:Â  52642848Â Â Â  1079800Â  Hashtable is 49 times faster

Note that the list search was just a straight search of an object in a 
list, not
a device attached to a bus. I don't know if that would add time, but it 
seems
that the savings using a hashtable are significant.

So I have two questions:

1. Would it make more sense to provide AP bus interfaces to search for
 Â Â Â  queue devices by APQN?

2. If so, shall we store the queue devices in a hashtable to make the
 Â Â Â  searches more efficient?
