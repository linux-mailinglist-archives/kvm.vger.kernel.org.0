Are you 100% sure? Last time I played with #VE, it only triggered on
misconfigurations/permission checks (lack of R/W/X, but P=1), not on P=0
pages.

Or are you referring to the MMIO misconfiguration trick that KVM does?

... in that case yes, I would like to see a VMCALL to just bounce that
trap back into KVM.

> (b) populate the EPT completely before entering the guest;

... because this will not help you in any way :).
