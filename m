Based on the effort being required from you to make sure this
patch is in good shape, maybe you could reconsider my suggestion
from a while ago for a single-CPUID-leaf interface, as discussed
at:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20210421201759.utsmhuopdmlhghbx@habkost.net/

A single-CPUID-leaf qmp_query_x86_cpuid() function that is
generic and not KVM-specific can probably be implemented in ~5
lines of code.

I'm not against the interface proposed here, but you are surely
going to get more friction and more complexity to deal with.
