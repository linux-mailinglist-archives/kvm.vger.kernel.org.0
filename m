Trapping ZCR_EL2 isn't possible, as it would UNDEF at EL1. Trapping
ZCR_EL1 accesses is possible though, but it'd mean leaving the SVE
traps enabled on guest exit, something we currently don't do.

We don't really have a good infrastructure for dealing with individual
sysregs (pKVM will eventually change that, but we're not there yet,
and it isn't clear how that'd apply to non-protected), so we'd have to
deal with the whole SVE EC.

What we could do is:

- set CPTR_EL2.TZ set on guest exit

- on SVE trap, reset ZCR_EL2, clear CPTR_EL2.TZ, reexecute the
  faulting instruction.

I can have a look at how badly it looks.

HVC and traps have the same basic cost. I seriously doubt you can
measure the difference on any real CPU.

Thanks,
