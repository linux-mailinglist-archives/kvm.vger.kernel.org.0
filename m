But as above, which systems *are* those? Everything that's on my radar 
would have drivers all competing for the platform bus - Intel and s390 
are somewhat the odd ones out in that respect, but are also non-issues 
as above. FWIW my iommu/bus dev branch has got as far as the final bus 
ops removal and allowing multiple driver registrations, and before it 
allows that, it does now have the common attach check that I sketched 
out in the previous discussion of this.

It's probably also noteworthy that domain->ops is no longer the same 
domain->ops that this code was written to check, and may now be 
different between domains from the same driver.

Thanks,
Robin.
