This wouldn't be a problem.  When the emulated i2c controller starts a
transaction on th edevice, it will be performed by the host i2c
controller and this will lead to the same config space write.

I have another question: would it be possible to expose this IRQ through
/dev/i2c-* instead of messing with VFIO?

In fact, adding support for /dev/i2c passthrough to QEMU has long been a
pet idea of mine (my usecase was different though: the idea was to write
programs for a microcontroller on an ARM single board computer and run
them under QEMU in emulation mode).  It's not trivial, because there
could be some impedence mismatch between the guest (which might be
programmed against a low-level controller or might even do bit banging)
and the i2c-dev interface which is more high level.  Also QEMU cannot do
clock stretching right now.  However, it's certainly doable.

Yes, see above for an example.
