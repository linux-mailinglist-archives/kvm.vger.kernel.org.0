There are two issues.

First, I have been conflating the ECAM and MMIO ranges, and you only
made me realise that they were supposed to be independent.  I still
think the keying on highmem is wrong, but the main issue is that the
highmem* flags don't quite describe the shape of the platform.

All these booleans indicate is whether the feature they describe (the
high MMIO range, the high ECAM range, and in one of my patches the
high RD range) are *allowed* to live above 4GB, but do not express
whether then are actually usable (i.e. fit in the PA range).

Maybe we need to be more thorough in the way we describe the extended
region in the VirtMachineState structure:

- highmem: overall control for anything that *can* live above 4GB
- highmem_ecam: Has a PCIe ECAM region above 256GB
- highmem_mmio: Has a PCIe MMIO region above 256GB
- highmem_redist: Has 512 RDs above 256GB

Crucially, the last 3 items must fit in the PA range or be disabled.

We have highmem_ecam which is keyed on highmem, but not on the PA
range.  highmem_mmio doesn't exist at all (we use highmem instead),
and I'm only introducing highmem_redist.

For these 3 ranges, we should have something like

vms->highmem_xxx &= (vms->highmem &&
		     (vms->memmap[XXX].base + vms->vms->memmap[XXX].size) < vms->highest_gpa);

and treat them as independent entities.  Unless someone shouts, I'm
going to go ahead and implement this logic.

Thanks,

	M.
