The difference is that so far, we have always considered i-caches to
be private to each CPU. With a hypervisor that allows migration of
vcpus from one physical CPU to another, the i-cache isn't private
anymore from the perspective of the vcpus.

I think that's the allocation in unified caches, and not necessarily
the i-cache, given that it also mention things such as "Inner
Write-Through", which makes no sense for the i-cache.

Exactly, and that's what breaks things.

But that isn't what concerns me. FWB is exclusively documented in
terms of d-cache, and doesn't describe how that affects the
instruction fetch (which is why I'm reluctant to attribute any effect
to it).

Thanks,
