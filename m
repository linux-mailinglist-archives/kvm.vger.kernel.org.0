I think you're missing a very important aspect here called reality.

Let's say that HV is a huge cloud vendor who means a lot of $ and a
huge use case for SEV tech. And let's say that same HV is doing those
incompatible things.

Now imagine you break it with the spec change. But they already have
a gazillion of deployments on real hw which they can't simply update
just like that. Hell, cloud vendors are even trying to dictate how CPU
vendors should do microcode updates on a live system, without rebooting,
and we're talking about some wimpy fields in some table.

Now imagine your business unit calls your engineering and says, you need
to fix this because a very persuasive chunk of money.

What you most likely will end up with is an ugly ugly workaround after a
lot of managers screaming at each other and you won't even think about
breaking that HV.

Now imagine you've designed it the right and unambiguous way from the
getgo. You wake up and realize, it was all just a bad dream...

Yes, exactly. Fail immediately.

Thx.
