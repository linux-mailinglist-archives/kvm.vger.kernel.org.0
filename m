I'm not really talking about a specific, rather any tool which wants
to deal with SEV and QEMU, whether libvirt or an app using libvirt,
or something else using QEMU directly.

Where does the actual cert chain payload come from ? Is that something
the app has to acquire out of band, or can the full cert chain be
acquired from the hardware itself ?

This approach isn't future proof if subsequent generations introduce
new certs. It feels like we should be explicitly reporting something
about the certs rather than relying on every app to re-implement tihs
logic.
