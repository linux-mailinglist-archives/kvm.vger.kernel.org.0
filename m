But then I need to find the right one, plus I also need to find the
right one for the procfs side. That gets messy, and I already have no
idea how to really test this. Shared address_space is the same trick
we're using in drm (where we have multiple things all pointing to the
same underlying resources, through different files), and it gets the
job done. So that's why I figured the shared address_space is the
cleaner solution since then unmap_mapping_range takes care of
iterating over all vma for us. I guess I could reimplement that logic
with our own locking and everything in revoke_devmem, but feels a bit
silly. But it would also solve the problem of having mutliple
different mknod of /dev/kmem with different address_space behind them.
Also because of how remap_pfn_range works, all these vma do use the
same pgoff already anyway.
