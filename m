Indeed. But there isn't much we can do about that, and it should be
clear to anyone who's remotely involved in this crap that migration to
different systems is risky business.

Exactly. We just need to give it enough of the proverbial rope...

Hence finally making it clear the big-little is a large scale,
industry wide erratum? Sign me up! :D

More seriously, I'd expect this to be an ARM spec. But it wouldn't
hurt having a prototype that serves as a draft for the spec. Better
doing that than leaving it to... someone else.
