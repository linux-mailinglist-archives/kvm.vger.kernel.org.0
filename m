That HW will be with us for a *very* long time, given how popular
things like A53 and A72 have been (and still are).

It does. Passing --aarch32 as a parameter results in AArch32 EL1 being
selected. The only thing that doesn't work with kvmtool and this flag
is the kvmtool-provided init when booting a 32bit kernel directly (we
only carry a 64bit version). This should not affect unit tests, which
are standalone.
