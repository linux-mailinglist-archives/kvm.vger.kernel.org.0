Intel SDM section 25.2 OTHER CAUSES OF VM EXITS specifies the following
on INIT signals: "Such exits do not modify register state or clear pending
events as they would outside of VMX operation."

When commit 48adfb0f2e8e ("x86: vmx: Test INIT processing during various CPU VMX states")
was applied, I interepted above Intel SDM statement such that
VMX_INIT exit donâ€™t consume the pending LAPIC INIT event.

However, when Nadav Amit run the unit-test on a bare-metal
machine, it turned out my interpetation was wrong. i.e. VMX_INIT
exit does consume the pending LAPIC INIT event.
(See: https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg196757.html)

Therefore, fix unit-test code to behave as observed on bare-metal.
i.e. End unit-test with the following steps:
1) Exit VMX operation and verify it still continues to run properly
as pending LAPIC INIT event should have been already consumed by
VMX_INIT exit.
2) Re-enter VMX operation and send another INIT signal to keep it
blocked until exit from VMX operation.
3) Exit VMX operation and verify that pending LAPIC INIT signal
is processed when exiting VMX operation.
