Yes, *after* the store as completed. If you replay the instruction,
the same store comes out.

But that's the VMM's problem. If it has modified its own state and
doesn't return to the guest to complete the instruction, that's just
as bad as a load, which *do* have side effects as well.

Overall, the guest state exposed by KVM is always correct, and
replaying the instruction is not going to change that. It is if the
VMM is broken that things turn ugly *for the VMM itself*, and I claim
that no amount of flag being added is going to help that.
