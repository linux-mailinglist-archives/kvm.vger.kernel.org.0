[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the syzbot reports that have (re-)occurred in the last 7 days, I've manually
marked 4 of them as possibly being bugs in the kvm subsystem.  I've listed these
bug reports below.

Of these 4 reports, 1 was bisected to a commit from the following person:

	Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>

I've manually checked that this bisection result looks plausible.

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close it by sending a '#syz
fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the original thread, as
explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the kvm subsystem, please let me know
and (if possible) forward it to the correct place.

Note: in total, I've actually assigned 25 open syzbot reports to this subsystem.
But to help focus people's efforts, I've only listed the 4 that have
(re-)occurred in the last week.  Let me know if you want the full list.

Here are the bug reports:
