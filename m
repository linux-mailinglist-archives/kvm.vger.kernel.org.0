Thanks you!

Sure, let's wait for Sean's feedback. But I am very positive with the 
results, as we have lantecy improvements for RT, and IIUC performance 
improvements for non-RT.

While we wait, I ran stress-ng in a VM with non-RT kernel (rcu.patience=0), 
and could see instruction count raising in around 1.5% after applying the patch.

Maybe I am missing something, but I thought we could get the ~4.5% 
improvement as seen above.

Thanks!
