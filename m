Indeed, and maybe this is what should be fixed instead of moving the
resampling point around (I was suggesting something along these lines
in [1]).

We already do this on arm64 for the timer, and it should be easy
enough it generalise to any interrupt backed by the GIC (there is an
in-kernel API to sample the pending state). No idea how that translate
for other architectures though.
