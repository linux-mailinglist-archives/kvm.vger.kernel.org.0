Yes, this is my concern. And there are some other scenarios.

1. If a non-pinned iommu-backed domain is detached between starting dirty log and retrieving
dirty bitmap, then the dirty log is missed (As you said in the last paragraph).

2. If all vendor drivers pinned (means iommu pinned_scope is true), and an vendor driver do pin/unpin
pair between starting dirty log and retrieving dirty bitmap, then the dirty log of these unpinned pages
are missed.

I get what you mean ;-). You said that there is time gap between we attach a device
and this device declares itself is dirty traceable.

However, this makes it difficult to management dirty log tracking (I list two bugs).
If the vfio devices can declare themselves dirty traceable when attach to container,
then the logic of dirty tracking is much more clear ;-) .

Since that you want to allow the time gap between we attach device and the device
declare itself dirty traceable, I am going to fix these two bugs in patch v2. Do you
agree?

Thanks,
