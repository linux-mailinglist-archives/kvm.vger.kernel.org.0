Unless kvm-unit-tests is being run in L1, in which case things like this
are painful.  That being said, I do agree that probing "all" VMCS fields
is the way to go.  Walking from highest->lowest probably won't even take
all that many VMREADS.  If it is slow, the test can be binned to its own
config.
