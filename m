I disagree here. This makes the ABI inconsistent, and means that no
feature can be implemented without changing userspace. If you can deal
with the existing features, you should be able to deal with the next
lot.

My proposal is that we have a single pseudo-register exposing the list
of implemented by the kernel. Clear the bits you don't want, and write
back the result. As long as you haven't written anything, you have the
full feature set. That's pretty similar to the virtio feature
negotiation.
