You missed the g_autofree, whose job is to call g_free() on all points
in the control flow where the malloc()d memory goes out of scope
(equivalent in expressive power to alloca()d memory going out of scope).
 Although the code is arguably a bit slower (as heap manipulations are
not as cheap as stack manipulations), in the long run that speed penalty
is worth the safety factor (since stack manipulations under user control
are inherently unsafe).
