No, we do not want to keep the page forever. I probably should
have been clearer. There are times we do a reset - e.g., on remove
of the mdev - at which time there should be no KVM pointer, or
else the remove will not be allowed. Of course, we won't do the
reset either, so I guess you can ignore my comment. If there is
no KVM pointer yet a page remains pinned, something bad
happened.
