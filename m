Do not talk about what your patch does - that should hopefully be
visible in the diff itself. Rather, talk about *why* you're doing what
you're doing.

This one is not really introduced - it is already there.

<snip all the complex rest>

So this patch is making my head spin. It seems we're dancing a lot of
dance just to have our CPUID page present at all times. Which begs the
question: do we need it during the whole lifetime of the guest?

Regardless, I think this can be simplified by orders of
magnitude if we allocated statically 4K for that CPUID page in
arch/x86/boot/compressed/mem_encrypt.S, copied the supplied CPUID page
from the firmware to it and from now on, work with our own copy.

You probably would need to still remap it for kernel proper but it would
get rid of all that crazy in this patch here.

Hmmm?
