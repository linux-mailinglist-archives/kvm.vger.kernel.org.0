Now I have discussed with Pierre and there IS a state that we want to migrate.
The topology change state is a guest wide bit that might be still set when
topology is changed->bit is set
guest is not yet started
migration

2 options:
1. a vmstate with that bit and migrate the state
2. always set the topology change bit after migration
