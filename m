I can't see why it couldn't be.

Different tack: if KVM is compiled out entirely, the command isn't
there, and trying to use it fails like

    {"error": {"class": "CommandNotFound", "desc": "The command query-kvm-cpuid has not been found"}}

If KVM is compiled in, but disabled, e.g. with -machine accel=tcg, then
the command fails like

    {"error": {"class": "GenericError", "desc": "VCPU was not initialized yet"}}

This is misleading.  The VCPU is actually running, it's just the wrong
kind of VCPU.

Perhaps this one is closer to reality.
