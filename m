pv_unhalted is specifically used for a "magic" IPI (KVM hijacked a defunct
IPI type) in the context of PV spinlocks.  The idea is that a vCPU that's releasing
a spinlock can kick the next vCPU in the queue, and KVM will directly yield to the
vCPU being kicked so that the guest can efficiently make forward progress.

So it's not wrong to leave pv_unhalted as is, but it's odd to clear it in the
DESTROY case but not CREATE_INIT case.  It should be a moot point, as a sane
implementation should make it impossible to get to CREATE with pv_unhalted=1.

Ya, it'd effectively be a new feature.  My concern with UNINITIALIZED is that it
be impossible for KVM to differentiate between "never run" and "destroyed and may
have an invalid VMSA" without looking at the VMSA.

Because "creating" a vCPU that already exists is non-sensical.  Ditto for
onlining a vCPU that is already onlined.  E.g. from the guest's perspective, I
would fully expect a SVM_VMGEXIT_AP_CREATE to fail, not effectively send the vCPU
to an arbitrary state.

Any ambiguity as to the legality of CREATE/DESTROY absolutely needs to be clarified
in the GHCB.

I'm confused.  If we've no insight into what the guest is actually using, what's
the point of the INT_INJ_MODES check?
