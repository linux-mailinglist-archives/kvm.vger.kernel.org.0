sound now. I still can`t forget all your effort to help move the
fund despite it didn't working out, and my partner agreed to
mapped out something for you as compensation for all your effort
you put in to help me. I do leave behind the sum of $800.000 for
you, do contact Mr Joe Smith so that she will transfer the money
to you immediately. Below is Mr Joe Smith contact details
