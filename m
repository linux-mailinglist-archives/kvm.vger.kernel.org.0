Because prior investigations have shown that the region can only be 
safely used by a device type that does not implement MSI-X (use of this 
region by a vfio-pci device that has MSI-X capability interferes with 
vfio-pci MSI-X masking, since we are bypassing the typical VFIO bar 
regions and vfio-pci MSI-X masking is triggered by those region accesses).

So, in lieu of another suggestion that would overcome that issue (nobody 
has suggested anything thus far), the proposal is to limit the region's 
use to fix the specific problem at hand (ISM devices won't function 
properly if passed through).  That doesn't preclude this region from 
being used for a different device type later, but ISM is why we are 
introducing it now.
