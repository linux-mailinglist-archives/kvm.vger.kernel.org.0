The debug-swap feature was set to disabled by default. So that
could be just a docs problem to say if you want to use that
feature, then you must set the legacy-vm=false property. IOW
an opt-in to incompatible behaviour.

This justification mis-understands how machine types are actually
used in practice though. There is *zero* correlation between use
of the new machine types, and availabilty of the new kernel
interface. 

99% of usage of QEMU, will just ask for the unversioned "q35"
/ "pc" machines. They will be expanded to the very latest machine
type version, either internally by QEMU, or by libvirt prior to
launching the VM.

Either way, you can expect essentially everything to be running on
the latest machine type versions, regardless of kernel version.

So making the latest machine types dependent on a kernel version
that is brand new is just not a sensible default. Latest QEMU
machines types need to work on kernel releases years old, without
expecting the user to set magic flags to avoid incompatibility.

Dynamic detection of SEV_INIT vs SEV-INIT2 is a bad idea as that
breaks migration when someone is moving from a host with new
kernel to an older kernel, while keeping the QEMU machine type
unchanged. The behaviour of what kernel feature to use must be
controllable with an explicit choice.
