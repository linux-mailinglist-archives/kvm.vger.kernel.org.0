You can keep it for now.  It may become clearer how to fix it after the
event loop is cleaned up.

The ioctls are not accessible while kvm_create_vm runs (only after
kvm_dev_ioctl_create_vm calls fd_install).  Even if it were, however,
you should have placed init_completion much earlier, otherwise
wait_for_completion would access uninitialized memory.
