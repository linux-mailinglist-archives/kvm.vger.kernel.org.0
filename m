My memory is that we have had very few reports of it actually causing
problems. But I don't have hard data to back that up.

It has tripped up the Clang folks, but that's partly because they're
building clang HEAD, and also because ~zero powerpc kernel developers
are building regularly with clang. I'm trying to fix the latter ...


The thing that makes me disable -Werror (enable PPC_DISABLE_WERROR) most
often is bisecting back to before fixes for my current compiler were
merged.

For example with GCC 8 if you go back before ~4.18 you hit the warning
fixed by bee20031772a ("disable -Wattribute-alias warning for
SYSCALL_DEFINEx()").

And then building with GCC head sometimes requires disabling -Werror
because of some new warning, sometimes valid sometimes not.

I think we could mostly avoid those problems by having the option only
on by default for known compiler versions.

eg:

config WERROR
	bool "Build with -Werror"
	default CC_IS_GCC && (GCC_VERSION >= 70000 && GCC_VERSION <= 90000)

And we could bump the upper version up once each new GCC version has had
any problems ironed out.

Right now I don't think we could have a generic option that's enabled by
default, there's too many warnings floating around on minor arches and
in odd configurations.

But we could have a generic option that signifies the desire to build
with -Werror where possible, and then each arch/subsystem/etc could use
that config option to enable -Werror in stages.

Then after a release or three we could change the option to globally
enable -Werror and opt-out any areas that are still problematic.

It's also possible to use -Wno-error to turn certain warnings back into
warnings even when -Werror is set, so that's another way we could
incrementally attack the problem.


It'd also be nice if we could do:

 $ make WERROR=0

Or something similarly obvious to turn off the WERROR option. That way
users don't even have to edit their .config manually, they just rerun
make with WERROR=0 and it works.

True, it was just the conservative choice to disable it for allmod/yes.
We should probably revisit that these days.

cheers
