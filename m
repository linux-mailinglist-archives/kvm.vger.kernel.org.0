Sorry, just saw this thread now.

What if we did what Linus suggests and hide (odd) user workers from
/proc/<pid>/task/* but also added /proc/<pid>/workers/*. The latter
would only list the workers that got spawned by the kernel for that
particular task? This would acknowledge their somewhat special status
and allow userspace to still detect them as "Hey, I didn't actually
spawn those, they got shoved into my workload by the kernel for me.".

(Another (ugly) alternative would be to abuse prctl() and have workloads
opt-in to hiding user workers from /proc/<pid>/task/.)
