Just to clarify in case people mis-interpreted my POV...

I think that testing a compatibility string at a device *is* useful, as
it allows for a final accurate safety check to be performed before the
migration stream starts. Libvirt could use that reasonably easily I
believe.

It just isn't sufficient for a complete solution.

In parallel with the device level test in sysfs, we need something else
to support the host placement selection problems in an efficient way, as
you are trying to address in the remainder of your mail.


Regards,
Daniel
