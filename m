The reason why the bug does not happen is because there is global
control. So disabling a counter will be effectively done in the global
disable part, ie., when guest PMU writes to MSR 0x38f.

So this will be an ugly bug in an ancient PMU.

right thing? yes. too strong.

no, if the counter is actually enabled, but then it is assigned to
old_fixed_ctr_ctrl, the value is truncated. When control goes to the
check at the time of disabling the counter, KVM thinks it is disabled,
since the value is already truncated to 0. So KVM will skip by saying
"oh, the counter is already disabled, why reprogram? No need!".

pmc_in_use is a terrible name. It seems the only usage point is for
LBR...

yes, I like pmc_is_locally_enabled(). But I don't know what is better
for pmc_in_use.

It is not benign, but does not matter for modern CPUs with Intel PerfMon
v2 and later. So, for virtualized environment, it might be still
critical for those VMs with PerfMon v1.

Thanks.
