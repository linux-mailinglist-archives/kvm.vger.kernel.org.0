I don't know about hardware timelines, but some future part can now opt
in to having debug registers as part of the encrypted state, and swapped
by VMExit, which would make debug facilities generally usable, and
supposedly safe to the #DB infinite loop issues, at which point the
hypervisor need not intercept #DB for safety reasons.

Its worth nothing that on current parts, the hypervisor can set up debug
facilities on behalf of the guest (or behind its back) as the DR state
is unencrypted, but that attempting to intercept #DB will redirect to
#VC inside the guest and cause fun. (Also spare a thought for 32bit
kernels which have to cope with userspace singlestepping the SYSENTER
path with every #DB turning into #VC.)

What currently exists is a picture of a house of cards in front of
something which has fallen down.

I have tried to get this point across.Â  Then again - its far easier for
the software folk in the same company as the hardware folk to make this
point.

I wasn't going to bring it up, but seeing as you have - while there are
prohibitively-complicating issues preventing it from working on native,
I don't see any point even considering it for the mess which is #VC, or
the even bigger mess which is #HV.
