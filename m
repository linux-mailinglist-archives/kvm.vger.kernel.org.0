This is such great news.

Can I further confirm that in any case, host/guest can use PMU resources,
such as some special more accurate counters ? Is there an end of story
for that static partitioning scheme ?

Coco pays a corresponding performance cost, and it's a paradox to hide
any performance trace of coco-guests from host's point of view.

Thanks for the input, Jim. Let me try to help.
