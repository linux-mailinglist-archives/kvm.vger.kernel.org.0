Thanks!

I'm still trying to iron a few issues, but you should be able to boot
a NV guest. However, the way it is enabled has changed: you need to
pass 'kvm-arm.mode=nested' to the command line instead of the previous
'kvm-arm.nested=1' which I have got rid of. That could well be the
issue.

With the current state of the tree (I just pushed another fix), you
should be able to boot a L1 guest hypervisor and a L2 guest. I'm
getting a crash at the point where the L2 guest reaches userspace
though, so something is broken in the PSTATE or ERET tracking, I'd
expect.
