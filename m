This is a new version of the series previously posted at [2], reworking
the vGIC and timer code to cope with the M1 braindead^Wamusing nature.

Hardly any change this time around, mostly rebased on top of upstream
now that the dependencies have made it in.

Tested with multiple concurrent VMs running from an initramfs.

* From v2:
  - Rebased on 5.13-rc1
  - Fixed a couple of nits in the GIC registration code

* From v1 [1]:
  - Rebased on Hector's v4 posting[0]
  - Dropped a couple of patches that have been merged in the above series
  - Fixed irq_ack callback on the timer path
