What's an internal property? Properties are there to make some field of an 
object introspectable and settable from command line and QEMU monitor or 
other external interfaces. If that's not needed for something why is it 
defined as a property in the first place and not just e.g. C accessor 
functions as part of the device's interface instead? I think this may be 
overusing QOM for things that may not need it and adding complexity where 
not needed. It reminds me of patches that wanted to export via-ide IRQs or 
ISA IRQs just to be able to connect them to other parts _of the same chip_ 
becuase this chip is modeled as multiple QOM objects for reusing code from 
those. But in reality the chip does not have such pins and these are 
internal connections so I think it would be better to model these as 
functions and not QOM constructs that the user can change. In general, if 
the device or object has an external connection or a knob that the user 
may need to change or connect to another device (like building a board 
from parts you can wire pins together) then those need properties or 
qemu_irqs but other "internal properties" may need some other way to 
access and often simple accessor functions are enough for this as these 
internal properties are only accessed form the code. That way we would not 
need even more complexity to hide these from the user, instead of that 
just don't expose them but use something else where a property is not 
needed. A property is just like an accessor function with additional 
complexity to expose it to other interfaces so it's externally settable 
and introspectable but we don't need those for internal properties so we 
can drop that complexity and get back to the accessor function at the 
bottom of it.
