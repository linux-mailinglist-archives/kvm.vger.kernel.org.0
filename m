Checked with Jiewen offline.

He didn't think there was an existing interface to tell the OS to map a
OperationRegion of SystemMemory as UC via the ACPI table. He thought the
OS/ACPI driver still needed to rely on MTRRs for the hint before there was an
alternative way.

It seems as hacky as this patch set?
