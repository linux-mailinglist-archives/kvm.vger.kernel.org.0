We'll get a new traps at L2 VM creation if we expose a PMU to the L1
guest, and if L2 gets one too. I don't think that's a real problem, as
the performance of an L2 PMU is bound to be hilarious, and if we are
really worried about that, we can always cache it locally. Which is
likely the best thing to do if you think of big-little.

Let's not think of big-little.

Another thing is that we could perfectly ignore the number of counter
on the host and always expose the architectural maximum, given that
the PMU is completely emulated. With that, no trap.

I looked into that and bailed out, as it creates interesting ordering
problems...

PMSWINC_EL0 is a RAZ/WO register, which really shouldn't have a shadow
counterpart (the storage is completely unused). Let me get rid on this
sucker in v2.

Thanks,
