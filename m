The two are linked. Exposing a new register to userspace and/or guest
result in the same thing: you can't rollback. That's specially true in
the QEMU case, which *learns* from the kernel what registers are
available, and doesn't maintain a fixed list.

Any new system register that is exposed by a new kernel feature breaks
rollback. And so far, we only consider it a bug if the set of exposed
registers reduces. Anything can be added safely (as checked by one of
the selftests added by Drew).

Fair enough. But this has to be done in a scalable way, which
individual capability cannot provide.

Well, you definitely achieved your goal of attracting my attention :).

The whole point is that these settings get exposed by
KVM_GET_REG_LIST, as this is QEMU's way to dump a VM state. Given that
we already have this for things like the spectre management state, we
can just as well expose the bitmaps that deal with the KVM-specific
hypercalls. After all, this falls into the realm of "KVM as VM
firmware".

For ARM-architected hypercalls (TRNG, stolen time), we may need a
similar extension.
