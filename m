I'm still missing a bit _what_ is actually supposed to be
compatible/incompatible. I'd assume some internal state descriptions
(even if this is not actually limited to migration).

I'm not sure that needs to go into the patch description (sounds like
it is rather a change log?)

Same here; simply drop the 'now'?

Again, I'd like an explanation here what kind of compatibility we're
talking about.

This changelog should go below the ---, so that it does not actually
show up in the patch description later :)

I would reword this a bit:

"This attribute provides a way to check device compatibility between
two mdev devices from userspace. The intended usage is for userspace to
read the version attribute from one mdev device and then writing that
value to the version attribute of the other mdev device. The second
mdev device indicates compatibility via the return code of the write
operation. This makes compatibility between mdev devices completely
vendor-defined and opaque to userspace."

We still should explain _what_ compatibility we're talking about here,
though.

Maybe put the defined return code into a bulleted list instead? But
this looks reasonable as well.
