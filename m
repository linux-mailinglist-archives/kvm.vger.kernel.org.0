Dear, 

Please confirm if you are still alive because two gentle men 
walked into my office this morning to claim your inheritance 
funds with our bank. They said that you are dead and that they 
are your  representative. 

I got your email from the file of your relative 
who is yet to be paid for the Contract he has executed before his 
death several years ago.

You the beneficiary of this fund has 
not been in contact with the bank to claim your fund. The 
gentlemen submitted an address where they want your VISA DEBIT 
ATM CARD sent. 

If you are still alive, please indicate by sending your full 
contact details within 7 day of receiving this message, faliure 
to do so, I will send the card to the address submitted by your 
representatives. 


Regards
