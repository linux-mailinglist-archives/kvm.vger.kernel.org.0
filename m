Well it doesn't help that my abbreviated explanation glosses over some
details. So here's the verbose explanation, and I'm sure Marc will have
a set of corrections too :) I meant there's no _explicit_ interaction
between UFFD and the various bits of GIC that need to touch guest
memory.

The GIC redistributors contain a set of MMIO registers that are
accessible through the KVM_GET_DEVICE_ATTR and KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR
ioctls. Writes to these are reflected directly into the KVM
representation, no biggie there.

One of the registers (GICR_PENDBASER) is a pointer to guest memory,
containing a bitmap of pending LPIs managed by the redistributor. The
ITS takes this to the extreme, as it is effectively a bunch of page
tables for interrupts. All of this state actually lives in a KVM
representation, and is only flushed out to guest memory when explicitly
told to do so by userspace.

On the target, we reread all the info when rebuilding interrupt
translations when userspace calls KVM_DEV_ARM_ITS_RESTORE_TABLES. All of
these guest memory accesses go through kvm_read_guest() and I expect the
usual UFFD handling for non-present pages kicks in from there.

Ack, I just feel rather strongly that the priority should be making
guest_memfd with whatever post-copy scheme we devise. Once we settle
on a UAPI that works for the new and shiny thing then it's easier to
rationalize applying the UAPI change to other memory backing types.
