This works for L2, but not L1 :-(  And L2 can't be fixed without first
fixing L1 because inject_pending_event() also incorrectly prioritizes #DB
over SMI.  For L1, utilizing SMRAM to save/restore the pending #DB is
likely the easiest solution as it avoids having to add new state for
migration.

I have everything coded up but it'll probably take a few weeks to test and
get it sent out, need to focus on other stuff for a while.
