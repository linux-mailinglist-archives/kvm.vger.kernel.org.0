Hi Alex,

Strangely your message never made it to me, and I had to pull this out
of Lore after seeing Daniel's reply to it. I wonder what's up.

No, I think the race is something that remains a problem for the
situations I care about. There are simpler ways of fixing that -- just
expose a single incrementing integer so that it can be checked every
time the RNG does something, without being expensive, via the same
mechanism -- and then you don't need any complexity. But anyway, that
doesn't exist right now, so this series tries to implement something for
what does exist and is already supported by multiple hypervisors. I'd
suggest sending a proposal for an improved mechanism as part of a
different thread, and pull the various parties into that, and we can
make something good for the future. I'm happy to implement whatever the
virtual hardware exposes.

Jason
