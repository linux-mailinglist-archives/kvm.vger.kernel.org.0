Oh, duh, there's an "if (atomic)" check right above this.

Yeah, I remember finding that flow.

This is effectively what I was asking about.

Right.  Might be worth adding a comment at some point to call out that disabling
IRQs may not be strictly required for all users, but it's done for simplicity.
Ah, if/when we add kvm_gpc_lock(), that would be the perfect place to document
the behavior.

Thanks!
