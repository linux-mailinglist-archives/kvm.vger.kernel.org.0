The main issue I have is that the system call addresses are not translated.

On one hand, I understand why it's done like this; it's pretty much 
impossible to do it without duplicating half of the sentry in the host 
kernel.  And the KVM API you're adding is certainly sensible.

On the other hand this makes the hypercall even more specialized, as it 
depends on the guest's memslot layout, and not self-sufficient, in the 
sense that the sandbox isn't secure without prior copying and validation 
of arguments in guest ring0.

Yeah, ~3000 clock cycles is what I would expect.

What does it translate to in terms of benchmarks?  For example a simple 
netperf/UDP_RR benchmark.
