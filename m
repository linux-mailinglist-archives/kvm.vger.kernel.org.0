Here's what I ended up with.  I also added kvm_memslot_insert_back() to
help document the purpose of incrementing used_slots, and renamed
kvm_shift_memslots_forward()->kvm_memslot_move_backward() and
kvm_shift_memslots_backward()->kvm_memslot_move_forward() because I was
having trouble reconciling having the comments focus on the changed
memslot while the names of the functions reflected what happens to the
other memslots.

 * Re-sort memslots based on their GFN to account for an added, deleted, or

 * lookup.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Slots are sorted from highest GFN to lowest GFN!  I.e. the entry
 * at memslots[0] has the highest GFN.
 *
 * The sorting algorithm takes advantage of having initially sorted memslots
 * and knowing the position of the changed memslot.  Sorting is also optimized
 * by not swapping the updated memslot and instead only shifting other memslots
 * and tracking the new index for the update memslot.  Only once its final
 * index is known is the updated memslot copied into its position in the array.
 *
 *  - When deleting a memslot, the deleted memslot simply needs to be moved to
 *    the end of the array.
 *
 *  - When creating a memslot, the algorithm "inserts" the new memslot at the
 *    end of the array and then it forward to its correct location.
 *
 *  - When moving a memslot, the algorithm first moves the updated memslot
 *    backward to handle the scenario where the memslot's GFN was changed to a
 *    lower value.  update_memslots() then falls through and runs the same flow
 *    as creating a memslot to move the memslot forward to handle the scenario
 *    where its GFN was changed to a higher value.
 *
 * Note, slots are sorted from highest->lowest instead of lowest->highest for
 * historical reasons.  Originally, invalid memslots where denoted by having
 * GFN=0, thus sorting from highest->lowest naturally sorted invalid memslots
 * to the end of the array.  The current algorithm uses dedicated logic when
 * deleting a memslot and thus does not rely on invalid memslots having GFN=0.
