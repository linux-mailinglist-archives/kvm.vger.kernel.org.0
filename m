I'm happy to address this if you are OK with the change in user
visible behaviour.

However, I am still struggling with my original goal, which is to
allow QEMU to create a usable KVM_based VM on systems with a small IPA
space (36 bits on the system I have). What would an acceptable way to
convey this to the code that deals with the virt memory map so that it
falls back to something that actually works?

Thanks,

	M.
