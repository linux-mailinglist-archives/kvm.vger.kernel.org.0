Not quite: translation faults are reported as reads if TCR_EL1.HA
isn't set, and as writes if it is. Ignoring TCR_EL1.HD for a moment,
this matches exactly the behaviour of the page-table walker, which
will update the S1 PTs only if this bit is set.

Or is it what userfaultfd does on its own? That'd be confusing...

s/old/young/ ?

I think you're confusing the PT access with the access that caused the
PT access (I'll have that printed on a t-shirt, thank you very much).

Here, we're not considering the cause of the PT access anymore. If
TCR_EL1.HA is set, the S1 PT page will be marked as accessed even on a
read, and only that page.

TCR_EL1.HD is what muddies the waters a bit. If it is set without HA
being set, we still handle the translation fault as a read, followed
by a write permission fault. But again, that's solely for the purpose
of the S1 PT. What happens for the mapped page is completely
independent.

I have the ugly feeling we're talking at cross purpose here, mostly
because I don't get how userfaultfd fits in that picture. Can you shed
some light here?

Thanks,
