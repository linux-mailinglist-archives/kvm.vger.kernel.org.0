Are the end perf user aware of the collection gaps caused by the code running 
under SGX?

As far as I know there shouldn't be one yet, we may need a tool like "perf-kvm" 
for SGX enclaves.

The KVM module parameter "enable_pmu" might be respected,
together with a per-TD guest user space control option.

Even the guest TD is under off-TD debug and is untrusted ?

I think we (host administrators) need to profile off-TD guests to locate
performance bottlenecks with a holistic view, regardless of whether the
ATTRIBUTES.PERFMON bit is cleared or not.

Perhaps shared memory could be a way to pass guests performance data
to the host if PMU activities are suppressed across TD entry and exit
transitions for the guest TD is under off-TD debug and is untrusted.

One protocol I've seen is that the (TD or normal) guest cannot compromise
the host's availability to PMU resources (at least in the host runtime).

It's pretty fine and expected that performance data within the trusted TDX guest
should be logically isolated from host data (without artificial aggregation).

When the code to enable ATTRIBUTES.PERFMON appears in the mailing list,
we can have more discussions in a very good time window.
