Thanks, just look at the SDM again. It seems I misunderstood the words. :(

Sure. When the mediated vPMU is proposed at the beginning, we considered to
support all kinds of HWs including some old may not broadly used HWs
nowadays, so we have to consider all kinds of corner cases. But think
twice, it may not be worthy...

Yes, I understood your meaning.Â  For passthough mode, KVM should not need
to access the guest PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL value. For interception mode, KVM
would maintain an emulated guest PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL value and don't need to
read/write it from/to VMCS guest fields.

Anyway, it looks these two helpers are useless, it can be removed.
