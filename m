+ *
+ * device_state: (read/write)
+ *      - The user application writes to this field to inform the vendor driver
+ *        about the device state to be transitioned to.
+ *      - The vendor driver should take the necessary actions to change the
+ *        device state. After successful transition to a given state, the
+ *        vendor driver should return success on write(device_state, state)
+ *        system call. If the device state transition fails, the vendor driver
+ *        should return an appropriate -errno for the fault condition.
+ *      - On the user application side, if the device state transition fails,
+ *	  that is, if write(device_state, state) returns an error, read
+ *	  device_state again to determine the current state of the device from
+ *	  the vendor driver.
+ *      - The vendor driver should return previous state of the device unless
+ *        the vendor driver has encountered an internal error, in which case
+ *        the vendor driver may report the device_state VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_ERROR.
+ *      - The user application must use the device reset ioctl to recover the
+ *        device from VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_ERROR state. If the device is
+ *        indicated to be in a valid device state by reading device_state, the
+ *        user application may attempt to transition the device to any valid
+ *        state reachable from the current state or terminate itself.
+ *
+ *      device_state consists of 3 bits:
+ *      - If bit 0 is set, it indicates the _RUNNING state. If bit 0 is clear,
+ *        it indicates the _STOP state. When the device state is changed to
+ *        _STOP, driver should stop the device before write() returns.
+ *      - If bit 1 is set, it indicates the _SAVING state, which means that the
+ *        driver should start gathering device state information that will be
+ *        provided to the VFIO user application to save the device's state.
+ *      - If bit 2 is set, it indicates the _RESUMING state, which means that
+ *        the driver should prepare to resume the device. Data provided through
+ *        the migration region should be used to resume the device.
+ *      Bits 3 - 31 are reserved for future use. To preserve them, the user
+ *      application should perform a read-modify-write operation on this
+ *      field when modifying the specified bits.

+ * 0. Default state of VFIO device is _RUNNNG when the user application starts.
+ * 1. During normal shutdown of the user application, the user application may
+ *    optionally change the VFIO device state from _RUNNING to _STOP. This
+ *    transition is optional. The vendor driver must support this transition but
+ *    must not require it.
+ * 2. When the user application saves state or suspends the application, the
+ *    device state transitions from _RUNNING to stop-and-copy and then to _STOP.
+ *    On state transition from _RUNNING to stop-and-copy, driver must stop the
+ *    device, save the device state and send it to the application through the
+ *    migration region. The sequence to be followed for such transition is given
+ *    below.
+ * 3. In live migration of user application, the state transitions from _RUNNING
+ *    to pre-copy, to stop-and-copy, and to _STOP.
+ *    On state transition from _RUNNING to pre-copy, the driver should start
+ *    gathering the device state while the application is still running and send
+ *    the device state data to application through the migration region.
+ *    On state transition from pre-copy to stop-and-copy, the driver must stop
+ *    the device, save the device state and send it to the user application
+ *    through the migration region.
+ *    Vendor drivers must support the pre-copy state even for implementations
+ *    where no data is provided to the user before the stop-and-copy state. The
+ *    user must not be required to consume all migration data before the device
+ *    transitions to a new state, including the stop-and-copy state.
+ *    The sequence to be followed for above two transitions is given below.
+ * 4. To start the resuming phase, the device state should be transitioned from
+ *    the _RUNNING to the _RESUMING state.
+ *    In the _RESUMING state, the driver should use the device state data
+ *    received through the migration region to resume the device.
+ * 5. After providing saved device data to the driver, the application should
+ *    change the state from _RESUMING to _RUNNING.
+ *
+ * reserved:
+ *      Reads on this field return zero and writes are ignored.
+ *
+ * pending_bytes: (read only)
+ *      The number of pending bytes still to be migrated from the vendor driver.
+ *
+ * data_offset: (read only)
+ *      The user application should read data_offset field from the migration
+ *      region. The user application should read the device data from this
+ *      offset within the migration region during the _SAVING state or write
+ *      the device data during the _RESUMING state. See below for details of
+ *      sequence to be followed.
+ *
+ * data_size: (read/write)
+ *      The user application should read data_size to get the size in bytes of
+ *      the data copied in the migration region during the _SAVING state and
+ *      write the size in bytes of the data copied in the migration region
+ *      during the _RESUMING state.
+ *
+ * The format of the migration region is as follows:
+ *  ------------------------------------------------------------------
+ * |vfio_device_migration_info|    data section                      |
+ * |                          |     ///////////////////////////////  |
+ * ------------------------------------------------------------------
+ *   ^                              ^
+ *  offset 0-trapped part        data_offset
+ *
+ * The structure vfio_device_migration_info is always followed by the data
+ * section in the region, so data_offset will always be nonzero. The offset
+ * from where the data is copied is decided by the kernel driver. The data
+ * section can be trapped, mmapped, or partitioned, depending on how the kernel
+ * driver defines the data section. The data section partition can be defined
+ * as mapped by the sparse mmap capability. If mmapped, data_offset must be
+ * page aligned, whereas initial section which contains the
+ * vfio_device_migration_info structure, might not end at the offset, which is
+ * page aligned. The user is not required to access through mmap regardless
+ * of the capabilities of the region mmap.
+ * The vendor driver should determine whether and how to partition the data
+ * section. The vendor driver should return data_offset accordingly.
+ *
+ * The sequence to be followed while in pre-copy state and stop-and-copy state
+ * is as follows:
+ * a. Read pending_bytes, indicating the start of a new iteration to get device
+ *    data. Repeated read on pending_bytes at this stage should have no side
+ *    effects.
+ *    If pending_bytes == 0, the user application should not iterate to get data
+ *    for that device.
+ *    If pending_bytes > 0, perform the following steps.
+ * b. Read data_offset, indicating that the vendor driver should make data
+ *    available through the data section. The vendor driver should return this
+ *    read operation only after data is available from (region + data_offset)
+ *    to (region + data_offset + data_size).
+ * c. Read data_size, which is the amount of data in bytes available through
+ *    the migration region.
+ *    Read on data_offset and data_size should return the offset and size of
+ *    the current buffer if the user application reads data_offset and
+ *    data_size more than once here.
+ * d. Read data_size bytes of data from (region + data_offset) from the
+ *    migration region.
+ * e. Process the data.
+ * f. Read pending_bytes, which indicates that the data from the previous
+ *    iteration has been read. If pending_bytes > 0, go to step b.
+ *
+ * The user application can transition from the _SAVING|_RUNNING
+ * (pre-copy state) to the _SAVING (stop-and-copy) state regardless of the
+ * number of pending bytes. The user application should iterate in _SAVING
+ * (stop-and-copy) until pending_bytes is 0.
+ *
+ * The sequence to be followed while _RESUMING device state is as follows:
+ * While data for this device is available, repeat the following steps:
+ * a. Read data_offset from where the user application should write data.
+ * b. Write migration data starting at the migration region + data_offset for
+ *    the length determined by data_size from the migration source.
+ * c. Write data_size, which indicates to the vendor driver that data is
+ *    written in the migration region. Vendor driver must return this write
+ *    operations on consuming data. Vendor driver should apply the
+ *    user-provided migration region data to the device resume state.
+ *
+ * If an error occurs during the above sequences, the vendor driver can return
+ * an error code for next read() or write() operation, which will terminate the
+ * loop. The user application should then take the next necessary action, for
+ * example, failing migration or terminating the user application.
+ *
+ * For the user application, data is opaque. The user application should write
+ * data in the same order as the data is received and the data should be of
+ * same transaction size at the source.
