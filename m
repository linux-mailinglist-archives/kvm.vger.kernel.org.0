Yes, because QEMU has done hardware A/D updating since it first started
supporting riscv, which means it did svadu when neither svadu nor svade
were in the DT. The "fix" for that was to ensure we have svadu and !svade
by default, which means we've perfectly realized Alexandre's concern...
We should be able to change the named cpu types that don't support svadu
to only have svade in their DTs, since that would actually be fixing those
cpu types, but we'll need to discuss how to proceed with the generic cpu
types like 'max'.

Yes, I think that's what we're doing right now and documenting that
assumption is a good idea.

I think that ISA string format chapter implies that any extension name
that is in the specified format can be parsed, which implies it can be
interpreted as an available extension, even if it's not mentioned in
the spec. But maybe I'm just pushing a big foot into a small shoe since
I don't really want to try and figure out how to get that chapter
changed...
