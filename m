I'm not getting this warning. What are you compiling with? In general,
the compiler should shout about unused function parameters.

I'm not sure this actually need fixing. The dependencies on the input
and output will effectively prevent such reordering. That will
definitely be a good cleanup though, but maybe not worth taking out of
this series.
