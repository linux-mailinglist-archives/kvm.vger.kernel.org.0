Right, I'll switch everything over to INVALID_PAGE, which will also cause
an error on VMRUN, so that is good.

You'll end up with a VMRUN failure, which is likely to be the same result.
But I can look at what it would take to exit up to userspace before that.

If anything it should set it, since it will be "unhalted" now. But, I
looked through the code to try and understand if there was a need to set
it and didn't really see any reason. It is only ever set (at least
directly) in one place and is cleared everywhere else. It was odd to me.

Using the INVALID_PAGE value now (and even when it was 0), you'll get a
VMRUN failure.

The AP CREATE_ON_INIT is meant to be used with INIT-SIPI, so if the guest
hasn't done the right thing, then it will fail on VMRUN.

I'll look at KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED. Qemu doesn't reference that state at
all in the i386 support, though, which is why I went with UNINITIALIZED.

This can be made to return an int and then follow standard VMGEXIT processing.

Which reminds me to get a GHCB discussion going on returning some other
form of error besides exceptions.

I'm not sure... the guest is really trying to do an INIT-SIPI type of
action and if they don't do something correctly, we don't want to leave
the AP running in its previous state, hence the kick, so that it will end
up falling back to UNINITIALIZED state.

Why? If the guest wants to call it multiple times I guess I don't see a
reason that it would need to call DESTROY first and then CREATE. I don't
know why a guest would want to do that, but I don't think we should
prevent it.

That's because we can't really enforce it. The SEV_FEATURES value is part
of the VMSA, of which the hypervisor has no insight into (its encrypted).

The interrupt injection mechanism was specifically requested as a sanity
check type of thing during the GHCB review, and as there were no
objections, it was added (see the end of section 4.1.9).

I can definitely add the check for the SNP_ACTIVE bit, but it isn't required.

It came up in early discussions and so was included in the initial draft
of the GHCB SNP support. There wasn't any discussion about it nor any
objections, so it stayed.

Will do.

I'll work on that.
