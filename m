Who's "we"?

Please use passive voice in your text: no "we" or "I", etc.
Personal pronouns are ambiguous in text, especially with so many
parties/companies/etc developing the kernel so let's avoid them please.

Well, then fix it properly pls. Remove the -no-stack-protector, test it
and send it out, even separately if easier to handle. This version looks
half-baked, just so that it gets you what you need for the SNP stuff but
we don't do half-baked, sorry.

That needs some CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR ifdeffery around it, below too.
