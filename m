It sounds racy.  If the user doesn't provide the UUID then they need to
guess that an mdev device with the same parent and type is theirs.  How
do you resolve two instances of this happening in parallel and both
coming to the same conclusion which is their device.  If a user wants
this sort of headache they can call mdevctl with `uuidgen` but I don't
think we should encourage it further.

BTW, I've moved the project to https://github.com/mdevctl/mdevctl, the
latest commit in the tree above makes that change, I've also updated
the description on my repo to point to the new location.  Thanks,

Alex
