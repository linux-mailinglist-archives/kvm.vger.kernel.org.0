And they should not be. Mixing kernel proper and decompressor code needs
to stop and untangling that is a multi-year effort, unfortunately. ;-\

Nah, just call them rdmsr/wrmsr(). There is already {read,write}_msr()
tracepoint symbols in kernel proper and there's no point in keeping them
apart using different names - that ship has long sailed.

That sounds good too.

How about you model it after

static int msr_read(u32 msr, struct msr *m)

from arch/x86/lib/msr.c which takes struct msr from which you can return
either u32s or a u64?

The stuff you share between the decompressor and kernel proper you put
in a arch/x86/include/asm/shared/ folder, for an example, see what we do
there in the TDX patchset:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220124150215.36893-11-kirill.shutemov@linux.intel.com

I.e., you move struct msr in such a shared header and then you include
it everywhere needed.

The arch/x86/boot/ msr helpers are then plain and simple, without
tracepoints and exception fixups and you define them in ...boot/msr.c or
so.

If the patch gets too big, make sure to split it in a couple so that it
is clear what happens at each step.

How does that sound?

Thx.
