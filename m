Hi Oliver,

This goes against what we decided to support for the *only* publicly
available VMM that cares about save/restore, which is that we only
move forward and don't rollback. Hypercalls are the least of your
worries, and there is a whole range of other architectural features
that will have also appeared/disappeared (your own CNTPOFF series is a
glaring example of this).

I appreciate that you may have different considerations, but I felt
that it was important to state *why* this is the way it is.

Why do we need this? For future hypercalls, we could have some buy-in
capabilities. For existing ones, it is too late, and negative features
are just too horrible.

For KVM-specific hypercalls, we could get the VMM to save/restore the
bitmap of supported functions. That would be "less horrible". This
could be implemented using extra "firmware pseudo-registers" such as
the ones described in Documentation/virt/kvm/arm/psci.rst.

Thanks,

	M.
