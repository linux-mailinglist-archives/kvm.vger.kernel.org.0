Then could we document this design decision somewhere?

I believe people won't stop wondering why not inject #UD when no guest 
CPUID, when reading the code.

do you mean because guest might be able to use immediate form of MSR 
access even if the CPUID doesn't advertise it, should KVM emulate it on 
platform doesn't support it, to make sure immediate form of MSR access 
is always supported?
