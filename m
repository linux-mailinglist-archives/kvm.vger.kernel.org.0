First of all, please CC power management patches (including cpuidle, 
cpufreq etc) to linux-pm@vger.kernel.org (there are people on that list 
who may want to see your changes before they go in) and CC cpuidle 
material (in particular) to Peter Zijlstra.

Second, I'm not a big fan of this approach to be honest, as it kind of 
is a driver trying to play the role of a governor.

We have a "polling state" already that could be used here in principle 
so I wonder what would be wrong with that.Â  Also note that there seems 
to be at least some code duplication between your code and the "polling 
state" implementation, so maybe it would be possible to do some things 
in a common way?
