The other option is to use vm_type, which TDX is already planning on leveraging.
Paolo raised the question of whether or not the TDX type could be reused for SNP.
We should definitely sort that out before merging either series.  I'm personally
in favor of separating TDX and SNP, it seems inevitable that common code will
want to differentiate between the two.

Boo, there's no way to communicate to the guest that it's doing PVALIDATE wrong
is there?
