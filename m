NB, for terminology  when libvirt calls something "persistent" it just
means that there's a configuration file recorded on disk, thus when you
stop the thing, you can still query its config & restart it from that
same config later. 

The best solution for libvirt would be to cope with all 4 of those
classes. 1b is the least important for us, so not the end of the
world if it was missing.
