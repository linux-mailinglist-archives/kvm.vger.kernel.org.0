This patchset is implemented based on vector 1.0 spec to add vector support
in riscv Linux kernel. There are some assumptions for this implementations.

1. We assume all harts has the same ISA in the system.
2. We disable vector in both kernel andy user space [1] by default. Only
   enable an user's vector after an illegal instruction trap where it
   actually starts executing vector (the first-use trap [2]).
3. We detect "riscv,isa" to determine whether vector is support or not.

We defined a new structure __riscv_v_ext_state in struct thread_struct to
save/restore the vector related registers. It is used for both kernel space
and user space.
 - In kernel space, the datap pointer in __riscv_v_ext_state will be
   allocated to save vector registers.
 - In user space,
	- In signal handler of user space, the structure is placed
	  right after __riscv_ctx_hdr, which is embedded in fp reserved
	  aera. This is required to avoid ABI break [2]. And datap points
	  to the end of __riscv_v_ext_state.
	- In ptrace, the data will be put in ubuf in which we use
	  riscv_vr_get()/riscv_vr_set() to get or set the
	  __riscv_v_ext_state data structure from/to it, datap pointer
	  would be zeroed and vector registers will be copied to the
	  address right after the __riscv_v_ext_state structure in ubuf.

This patchset is rebased to v6.3-rc1 and it is tested by running several
vector programs simultaneously. It delivers signals correctly in a test
where we can see a valid ucontext_t in a signal handler, and a correct V
context returing back from it. And the ptrace interface is tested by
PTRACE_{GET,SET}REGSET. Lastly, KVM is tested by running above tests in
a guest using the same kernel image. All tests are done on an rv64gcv
virt QEMU.

Note: please apply the patch at [4] due to a regression introduced by
commit 596ff4a09b89 ("cpumask: re-introduce constant-sized cpumask
optimizations") before testing the series.

Specail thanks to Conor and Vineet for kindly giving help on- and off-list.

Changelog V16
 - Rebase to the latest for-next:
   - Solve conflicts at 7, and 17
 - Use as-instr to detect if assembler supports .option arch directive
   and remove dependency from GAS, for both ZBB and V.
 - Cleanup code in KVM vector
 - Address issue reported by sparse
 - Refine code:
   - Fix a mixed-use of space/tab
   - Remove new lines at the end of file

Changelog V15
 - Rebase to risc-v -next (v6.3-rc1)
 - Make V depend on FD in Kconfig according to the spec and shut off v
   properly.
 - Fix a syntax error for clang build. But mark RISCV_ISA_V GAS only due
   to https://reviews.llvm.org/D123515
 - Use scratch reg in inline asm instead of t4.
 - Refine code.
 - Cleanup per-patch changelogs.

Changelog V14
 - Rebase to risc-v -next (v6.2-rc7)
 - Use TOOLCHAIN_HAS_V to detect if we can enable Vector. And refine
   KBUILD_CFLAGS to remove v from default compile option.
 - Drop illegal instruction handling patch in kvm and leave it to a
   independent series[3]. The series has merged into 6.3-rc1
 - Move KVM_RISCV_ISA_EXT_V to the end of enum to prevent potential ABI
   breaks.
 - Use PT_SIZE_ON_STACK instead of PT_SIZE to fit alignment. Also,
   remove panic log from v13 (15/19) because it is no longer relevant.
 - Rewrite insn_is_vector for better structuring (change if-else chain to
   a switch)
 - Fix compilation error in the middle of the series
 - Validate size of the alternative signal frame if V is enabled
   whenever:
     - The user call sigaltstack to update altstack
     - A signal is being delivered
 - Rename __riscv_v_state to __riscv_v_ext_state.
 - Add riscv_v_ prefix and rename rvv appropriately
 - Organize riscv_v_vsize setup code into vector.c
 - Address the issue mentioned by Heiko on !FPU case
 - Honor orignal authors that got changed accidentally in v13 4,5,6

Changelog V13
 - Rebase to latest risc-v next (v6.2-rc1)
 - vineetg: Re-organize the series to comply with bisect-ability
 - andy.chiu: Improve task switch with inline assembly
 - Re-structure the signal frame to avoid user ABI break.
 - Implemnt first-use trap and drop prctl for per-task V state
   enablement. Also, redirect this trap from hs to vs for kvm setup.
 - Do not expose V context in ptrace/sigframe until the task start using
   V. But still reserve V context for size ofsigframe reported by auxv.
 - Drop the kernel mode vector and leave it to another (future) series.

Changelog V12 (Chris)
 - rebases to some point after v5.18-rc6
 - add prctl to control per-process V state

Chnagelog V10
