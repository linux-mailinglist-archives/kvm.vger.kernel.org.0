No, you are unfortunately wrong. The architecture applies to *any*
implementation, and makes no distinction between a HW implementation
of a SW version. This is why we call it an architecture, and not an
implementation.

Absolutely not.  If you start special casing things, then we end-up
having stupidly designed SW that tries to do stupid things based on
the supposed properties of an implementation.

We follow the architecture, all the architecture, nothing but the
architecture. The architecture is the only barrier between insanity
and pure madness! ;-)

Do you see how the kernel does exactly what the architecture says we
can do? Ignoring the write is a perfectly valid implementation of
UNPREDICTABLE.

So what we do is completely in line with the architecture. As such, no
need to document it any further, everything is already where it should
be. If someone tries to write code dealing with the GIC without
understanding the architecture, no amount of additional documentation
will help.

Thanks,
