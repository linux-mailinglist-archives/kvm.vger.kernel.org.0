yes.

TDX is initialized exactly as the above.

This RFC series introduces the 'kvm-type' for KVM_X86_SW_PROTECTED_VM. 
It's my fault that forgot to list the option of introducing 
sw_protected_vm object with CONFIDENTIAL_GUEST_SUPPORT interface.
Thanks for Isaku to raise it 
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230731171041.GB1807130@ls.amr.corp.intel.com/

we can specify KVM_X86_SW_PROTECTED_VM this way:

qemu  \
   -object sw-protected,id=swp0,... \
   -machine confidential-guest-support=swp0 \
   ...

What I want to discuss is whether providing the interface to users to 
allow them configuring which memory is/can be private. For example, QEMU 
can do it internally. If users wants a confidential guest, QEMU 
allocates private gmem for normal RAM automatically.
