It looks I used the inaccurate words in the comments. Yes, it's not 
*exclusive* from host's point view.Â  Currently the perf events created 
by KVM are task-pinned events, they are indeed possible to be preempted 
by CPU-pinned host events which have higher priority. This is a long 
term issue which vPMU encountered. We ever have some internal discussion 
about this issue, but it seems we don't have a good way to solve this 
issue thoroughly in current vPMU framework.

But if there is no such CPU-pinned events which have the highest 
priority on host, KVM perf events can share the HW resource with other 
host events with the way of time-multiplexing.
