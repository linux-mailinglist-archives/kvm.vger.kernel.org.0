Yeah, I think generalization of this would come in the form of either (1) 
the dumping ground of an actual "misc" controller, that you elude to, or 
(2) a kernel abstraction so you can spin up your own generic controller 
that has the {current, max, stat} support.  In the case of the latter, 
encryption IDs becomes a user of that abstraction.

Concern with a single misc controller would be that any subsystem that 
wants to use it has to exactly fit this support: current, max, stat, 
nothing more.  The moment a controller needs some additional support, and 
its controller is already implemented in previous kernel versionv as a 
part of "misc," we face a problem.

On the other hand, a kernel abstraction that provides just the basic 
{current, max, stat} support might be interesting if it can be extended by 
the subsystem instance using it.
