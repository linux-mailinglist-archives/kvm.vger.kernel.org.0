I can certainly see that argument. I'll add checks to enforce these
cases. If it breaks an existing hypervisor implementation, it's probably
better to have that happen early based on this initial reference
implementation rather than down the road when we actually need these
fields for something.

Yes that's correct.

Unfortunately, in sev_enable(), between the point where snp_init() is
called, and sev_status is actually set, there are a number of cpuid
intructions which will make use of do_vc_no_ghcb() prior to sev_status
being set (and it needs to happen in that order to set sev_status
appropriately). After that point, snp_cpuid_active() would no longer be
necessary, but during that span some indicator is needed in case this
is just an SEV-ES guest trigger cpuid #VCs.

Yah, I was trying to avoid causing issues for other early
implementations trying to make do with the current open-ended spec, but
that's probably a losing battle and it's probably better to try to get
everyone using the proposed reference implementation early on. I'll tighten
the code up in this regard and also send a new version of reference
implementation document to SNP mailing list for awareness.
