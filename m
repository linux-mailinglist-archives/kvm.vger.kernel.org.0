No idea but it is probably linked to the queue state and usage history.
I can use a lower sleep time and increment the retry count.

In the Linux AP code it is only used once, in the explicit
ap_queue_enable_interruption() function.

Yes, thanks, I will keep it as is, may be just play with msleep()time 
and retry count.
