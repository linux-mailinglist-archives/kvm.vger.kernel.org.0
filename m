Like other hardware dependent features, the functionality will not
promise to work properly if the guest uses the unsupported CPUID.

As a first step, we made the guest LBR feature only available for the
"migratable=off" user space, which is why we intentionally did not add
MSR_ARCH_LBR_* stuff to msrs_to_save_all[] in earlier versions.

But hopefully, we may make it at least migratable for Arch LBR.

I'm personally curious about the cost of using XSAVES to swicth
guest lbr msrs during vmx transaction, and if the cost is unacceptable,
we may ask the perf host to adjust different depths for threads.
