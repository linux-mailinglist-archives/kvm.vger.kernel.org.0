Yes, using guest suspend+resume is clearer.

Yes, it just requires staying in user space for a rather long time(I haven’t
tested it specifically, it might take several days or even dozens of days). As a
comment or commit message in the KVM, it is indeed better to make the
description more general, rather than restricting it to specific scenarios.

Yes, I also noticed this issue. But initially, I didn’t have a good idea for how
to fix it, because KVM can’t determine how long it will take to return to
userspace. If the guest is in user space only briefly, not restarting the KVM
software period timer is unreasonable. Using vcpu->wants_to_run seems good.
However, I am not very familiar with KVM_CAP_IMMEDIATE_EXIT. I will review its
history and try to run some tests.

Thank you for patiently. This is a big mistake I shouldn’t have made and I will
thoroughly review the code submission guidelines for kernel/KVM-x86 as provided
in following links:

Yep, I also think it’s better to handle this in a simple and consistent way.
Here are my thoughts:

There are two possible reasons why the new target_expiration might lag behind:

1. The KVM timer is stopped.
2. The period is smaller than the delay in processing the timer.

In the first case, the timer shouldn’t be counting down because cpu is stopped.
Therefore, we should keep the LAPIC current count as it was before stopping.
That means we need to record the delta between target_expiration and now before
stopping, and set it when starting timer in future.

***

In the second case, it appears to the guest that the timer source is not very
accurate and cannot deliver interrupts at precise times. In d8f2f498d9ed
("x86/kvm: fix LAPIC timer drift when guest uses periodic mode"), David made the
KVM periodic timer more accurate by adjusting the next target_expiration, as a
result, over a relatively long duration, we can observe more accurate timer
interrupt counts and intervals.

However, this approach doesn’t apply when the target_expiration is already
significantly behind. In that situation, even though the total number of timer
interrupts over a long duration may be correct, the interrupts themselves are
triggered too close together. In this situation, the guest would prefer to see
regular timer period, rather than an almost frantic burst of timer interrupts.

And as you mentioned, if KVM is not posting timer IRQs across CPUs, the guest
won’t even have a chance to see the interrupt storm, or even two consecutive
interrupts.

***

Given all the situations above, I don’t think it’s worth adding a lot of
complexity for this, it’s better to handle this in a simple and consistent way.

I really appreciate your patient corrections and advice. They have helped me
learn how to submit a good patch and I will also actively learn and abide by
these rules.
