Hello My Dear,

My Greetings to you, MY Dear This is my second email to you but No 
reply. Why? Please I need a good clarification / my question is;  have 
you received your charity offer this sum of €3.8 MILLION EUROS from the 
correspondence bank?

It's just because the donation offer this sum of €3.8 MILLION EUROS has 
been registered in your name for Humanitarian & Charity works to help 
those Less privileges and old folks living in your home town as part of 
rural & Charity Supports in your community.

Please i need your urgent clarifications. Have you received the donation 
offer or not yet?

Best Regards,
 From Mrs Helena Fredric,
Secretary of Economic & Development(OECD).
