The __FILL_RETURN_BUFFER in the VM-Exit path was recently modified and
changed how it clobbered EFLAGS, which causes KVM to think VM-Enter failed.
Commit 089dd8e53126 ("x86/speculation: Change FILL_RETURN_BUFFER to work
with objtool") introduced the change, but this is really a bug in KVM.  The
VM-Exit path shouldn't rely on __FILL_RETURN_BUFFER to set EFLAGS to a
specific state, i.e. EFLAGS was always being clobbered, it just happened to
work before now.

I'll get a patch sent out shortly.
