Add documentation for TDX host kernel support.  There is already one
file Documentation/x86/tdx.rst containing documentation for TDX guest
internals.  Also reuse it for TDX host kernel support.

Introduce a new level menu "TDX Guest Support" and move existing
materials under it, and add a new menu for TDX host kernel support.

 separation.
 
+TDX Host Kernel Support
+=======================
+
+TDX introduces a new CPU mode called Secure Arbitration Mode (SEAM) and
+a new isolated range pointed by the SEAM Ranger Register (SEAMRR).  A
+CPU-attested software module called 'the TDX module' runs inside the new
+isolated range to provide the functionalities to manage and run protected
+VMs.
+
+TDX also leverages Intel Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption (MKTME) to
+provide crypto-protection to the VMs.  TDX reserves part of MKTME KeyIDs
+as TDX private KeyIDs, which are only accessible within the SEAM mode.
+BIOS is responsible for partitioning legacy MKTME KeyIDs and TDX KeyIDs.
+
+Before the TDX module can be used to create and run protected VMs, it
+must be loaded into the isolated range and properly initialized.  The TDX
+architecture doesn't require the BIOS to load the TDX module, but the
+kernel assumes it is loaded by the BIOS.
+
+TDX boot-time detection
+-----------------------
+
+The kernel detects TDX by detecting TDX private KeyIDs during kernel
+boot.  Below dmesg shows when TDX is enabled by BIOS::
+
+  [..] tdx: BIOS enabled: private KeyID range: [16, 64).
+
+TDX module detection and initialization
+---------------------------------------
+
+There is no CPUID or MSR to detect the TDX module.  The kernel detects it
+by initializing it.
+
+The kernel talks to the TDX module via the new SEAMCALL instruction.  The
+TDX module implements SEAMCALL leaf functions to allow the kernel to
+initialize it.
+
+Initializing the TDX module consumes roughly ~1/256th system RAM size to
+use it as 'metadata' for the TDX memory.  It also takes additional CPU
+time to initialize those metadata along with the TDX module itself.  Both
+are not trivial.  The kernel initializes the TDX module at runtime on
+demand.
+
+Besides initializing the TDX module, a per-cpu initialization SEAMCALL
+must be done on one cpu before any other SEAMCALLs can be made on that
+cpu.
+
+The kernel provides two functions, tdx_enable() and tdx_cpu_enable() to
+allow the user of TDX to enable the TDX module and enable TDX on local
+cpu.
+
+Making SEAMCALL requires the CPU already being in VMX operation (VMXON
+has been done).  For now both tdx_enable() and tdx_cpu_enable() don't
+handle VMXON internally, but depends on the caller to guarantee that.
+
+To enable TDX, the user of TDX should: 1) hold read lock of CPU hotplug
+lock; 2) do VMXON and tdx_enable_cpu() on all online cpus successfully;
+3) call tdx_enable().  For example::
+
+        cpus_read_lock();
+        on_each_cpu(vmxon_and_tdx_cpu_enable());
+        ret = tdx_enable();
+        cpus_read_unlock();
+        if (ret)
+                goto no_tdx;
+        // TDX is ready to use
+
+And the user of TDX must be guarantee tdx_cpu_enable() has beene
+successfully done on any cpu before it wants to run any other SEAMCALL.
+A typical usage is do both VMXON and tdx_cpu_enable() in CPU hotplug
+online callback, and refuse to online if tdx_cpu_enable() fails.
+
+User can consult dmesg to see the presence of the TDX module, and whether
+it has been initialized.
+
+If the TDX module is not loaded, dmesg shows below::
+
+  [..] tdx: TDX module is not loaded.
+
+If the TDX module is initialized successfully, dmesg shows something
+like below::
+
+  [..] tdx: TDX module: attributes 0x0, vendor_id 0x8086, major_version 1, minor_version 0, build_date 20211209, build_num 160
+  [..] tdx: 262668 KBs allocated for PAMT.
+  [..] tdx: TDX module initialized.
+
+If the TDX module failed to initialize, dmesg also shows it failed to
+initialize::
+
+  [..] tdx: TDX module initialization failed ...
+
+TDX Interaction to Other Kernel Components
+------------------------------------------
+
+TDX Memory Policy
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+TDX reports a list of "Convertible Memory Region" (CMR) to tell the
+kernel which memory is TDX compatible.  The kernel needs to build a list
+of memory regions (out of CMRs) as "TDX-usable" memory and pass those
+regions to the TDX module.  Once this is done, those "TDX-usable" memory
+regions are fixed during module's lifetime.
+
+To keep things simple, currently the kernel simply guarantees all pages
+in the page allocator are TDX memory.  Specifically, the kernel uses all
+system memory in the core-mm at the time of initializing the TDX module
+as TDX memory, and in the meantime, refuses to online any non-TDX-memory
+in the memory hotplug.
+
+This can be enhanced in the future, i.e. by allowing adding non-TDX
+memory to a separate NUMA node.  In this case, the "TDX-capable" nodes
+and the "non-TDX-capable" nodes can co-exist, but the kernel/userspace
+needs to guarantee memory pages for TDX guests are always allocated from
+the "TDX-capable" nodes.
+
+Physical Memory Hotplug
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Note TDX assumes convertible memory is always physically present during
+machine's runtime.  A non-buggy BIOS should never support hot-removal of
+any convertible memory.  This implementation doesn't handle ACPI memory
+removal but depends on the BIOS to behave correctly.
+
+CPU Hotplug
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+TDX module requires the per-cpu initialization SEAMCALL (TDH.SYS.LP.INIT)
+must be done on one cpu before any other SEAMCALLs can be made on that
+cpu, including those involved during the module initialization.
+
+The kernel provides tdx_cpu_enable() to let the user of TDX to do it when
+the user wants to use a new cpu for TDX task.
+
+TDX doesn't support physical (ACPI) CPU hotplug.  During machine boot,
+TDX verifies all boot-time present logical CPUs are TDX compatible before
+enabling TDX.  A non-buggy BIOS should never support hot-add/removal of
+physical CPU.  Currently the kernel doesn't handle physical CPU hotplug,
+but depends on the BIOS to behave correctly.
+
+Note TDX works with CPU logical online/offline, thus the kernel still
+allows to offline logical CPU and online it again.
+
+Kexec()
+~~~~~~~
+
+There are two problems in terms of using kexec() to boot to a new kernel
+when the old kernel has enabled TDX: 1) Part of the memory pages are
+still TDX private pages; 2) There might be dirty cachelines associated
+with TDX private pages.
+
+The first problem doesn't matter.  KeyID 0 doesn't have integrity check.
+Even the new kernel wants use any non-zero KeyID, it needs to convert
+the memory to that KeyID and such conversion would work from any KeyID.
+
+However the old kernel needs to guarantee there's no dirty cacheline
+left behind before booting to the new kernel to avoid silent corruption
+from later cacheline writeback (Intel hardware doesn't guarantee cache
+coherency across different KeyIDs).
+
+Similar to AMD SME, the kernel just uses wbinvd() to flush cache before
+booting to the new kernel.
