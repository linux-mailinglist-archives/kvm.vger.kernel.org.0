Hum, yes sorry, I posted this to give a response to the kvm-test-unit 
css test.

I should have a lot more rework this old device before to post this series.
In between I did, so I will post a v2 which will suppress all these 
approximations.

The first goal is to test basic I/O from inside the kvm-unit-test, 
producing errors and see how the system respond to errors.

In a standard system errors will be generated by QEMU analysing the I/O 
instruction after interception.

In a secured guest, we expect the same errors, however we want to check 
this.

This PONG device is intended to be low level, no VIRTIO, and to allow 
basic I/O.

Writing a VIRTIO driver inside the kvm-unit-test is something we can do 
in the future.

As you said, the common code already handle NOP and TIC, the 
interpretation of the
CCW chain, once the SSCH has been intercepted is done by QEMU.
I do not think it would be different with SE.

The kvm-unit-test part is in development too.

Doing a SenseID will be implemented to recognize the PONG device.

Yes, that is something I plan to do.

To sum-up:

in kvm-unit-test: implement all I/O instructions and force instructions 
errors, like memory error, operand etc. and expect the right reaction of 
the system.

in QEMU, add the necessary infrastructure to test this.
