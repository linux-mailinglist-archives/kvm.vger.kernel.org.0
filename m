My hope was that the trick of using the event generation to work
around systems failing to broadcast events could become a thing of the
past when WFET is present in the HW. After all, they serve the same
purpose (generate a local event to un-wedge the CPU).

But the more I look at it, the more I hate the potential solution. One
of the issues is that WFxT takes an absolute deadline, rather than a
relative one. So you end up with things like:

	ISB
	MRS	x0, CNTVCT_EL0
	ADD	x0, x0, #some_small_value
	WFET	x0

which is really heavy handed for the slow path of an atomic operation.
Even if you have ECV and CNTVCTSS_EL0 (which allows you to get rid of
the ISB), it is a royal pain.

It would be much better if there was a *relative* version of WFET that
would directly take a timeout relative to the current virtual count,
but I can sense HW designers calling me names already, so I'll shut
up.
