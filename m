So since you want to parse the EFI table in the boot stage, that tells
me that you need the blob in the early, boot kernel too, correct?

Ack.

So, you need to pass only an address, right?

How workable would it be if you had a cmdline option:

	cc_blob_address=0xb1a

with which you tell the kernel where that thing is?

Because then you can use this in both cases - EFI and !EFI.

Or is this blob platform-dependent and the EFI table contains it and
something needs to get it out of there, even if it were a user to
type in the cmdline cc_blob_address or some script when it comes to
containers...?

In any case, setup_data is kinda the generic way to pass arbitrary data
to the kernel so in this case, you can prioritize the EFI table in the
EFI case and fall back to setup_data if there's no EFI table...

Yah, let's see what requirements they'd come back with.

Thx.
