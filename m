I've overlooked the wait for empty. Maybe that return 0 had a part in
it. I now remember me insisting on having the wait code added when the
interrupt support was in the make. Sorry!

If we have given up on out of retries retries, we are in trouble anyway.

Yes, but these should be cleaned up before the KVM pointer becomes
null. We don't want to keep the page with the notifier byte pinned
forever, or?
