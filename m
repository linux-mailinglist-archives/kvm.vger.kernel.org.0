This will have an impact on TSC frequency. Core crystal clock frequency 
is also used to calculate TSC frequency.

I'm wondering what's the attitude of KVM community to provide support 
CPUID leaf 0x15? Even KVM decides to never advertise CPUID 0x15 in 
GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID, hard-coded APIC frequency puts additional 
limitation when userspace want to emualte CPUID 0x15
