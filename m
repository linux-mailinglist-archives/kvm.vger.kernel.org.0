Thinking more about, perhaps now I understand better why it was
introduced, and it should be related to the above.

In practice, "replies" are almost always queued in the intermediate
queue (send_pkt_queue) directly by the RX worker (rx_work) during its
execution. These are direct responses handled by
virtio_transport_recv_pkt() to requests coming from the other peer (the
host usually or sibling VM in your case). This happens for example
calling virtio_transport_reset_no_sock() if a socket is not found, or
sending back VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RESPONSE packet to ack a request of a
connection coming with a VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_REQUEST packet.

Because of this, if the number of these "replies" exceeds an arbitrary
threshold, the RX worker decides to de-schedule itself, to give space to
the TX worker (send_pkt_work) to move those "replies" from the
intermediate queue into the TX virtqueue, at which point the TX worker
will reschedule the RX worker to continue the job. So more than avoiding
deadlock, it seems to be a mechanism to avoid starvation.

Note that this is not necessary in vhost-vsock (which uses the same
functions as this driver, e.g. virtio_transport_recv_pkt), because both
workers already use vhost_exceeds_weight() to avoid this problem as
well.

At this point I think that doing something similar to vhost here as well
would allow us not only to avoid the problem that `queued_replies`
should avoid, but also that the RX worker monopolizes the workqueue
during data transfer.

Thanks,
Stefano
