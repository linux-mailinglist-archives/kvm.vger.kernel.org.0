Forgot to tell the update that we went the direction to identify the TDX 
vm_type based on confidential-guest_support like below:


if (ms->cgs && object_dynamic_cast(OBJECT(ms->cgs), TYPE_TDX_GUEST)) {
         kvm_type = KVM_X86_TDX_VM;
} else {
         kvm_type = KVM_X86_DEFAULT_VM;
}


I think it's what you want, right?

BTW, the whole next version of TDX QEMU series should be released with 
next version of TDX KVM series. But I cannot tell the exact date yet.
