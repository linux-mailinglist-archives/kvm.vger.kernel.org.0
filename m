Ahh, that makes sense.

Does SGX cause problem for these people?  It can create some of the same
collection gaps:

	performance monitoring activities are suppressed when entering
	an opt-out (of performance monitoring) enclave.

It's fine with *me*, but I'm not too picky about the PMU.  But, it
sounded like Peter was pretty concerned about it.

In any case, if we (Linux folks) need a change, it's *possible* because
most of this policy is implemented in software in the TDX module.  It
would just be painful for the folks who came up with the existing mechanism.
