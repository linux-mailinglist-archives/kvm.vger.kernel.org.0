Thanks! I think I sent out v10 a bit too early, but hopefully it looks 
like everyone agrees on the suspend code in it at the moment?

As a next step, I was thinking of reposting and starting a discussion on 
the reuse timer calibration patch separately. Its not part of parallel 
smp, but in my testing, it takes away (70ms) ~70% of the remaining 
parallel smpboot time. With the machine and kernel I am testing, the 
kexec reboot time after parallel smp is just under a second, so this 
represents ~7% of the boot time, which is a notable percentage reduction 
in server downtime. Or maybe someone could reply to this thread saying 
its not a good idea to post it as I remember there were quite a few 
reservations about it? :)

Thanks,
Usama
