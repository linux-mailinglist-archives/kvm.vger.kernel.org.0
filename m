Yup. It also begs the question of why we have producer callbacks, as
nobody seems to use them.

From a KVM perspective, we can't return a success because there is no
guest LPI that matches the input signal.

And such failure seems to be expected by the VFIO code, which just
prints a message on the console and set the producer token to NULL. So
returning an error from the KVM code is useful, at least to an extent.

Thanks,
