Yes, and that's what an implementation requires.

Are you sure? It really should be GICD_ISPENDR. I'll assume that this
is what you mean below.

Yes, or cleared by a write to GICD_ICPENDR. You really need to think
of the input into the GIC as some sort of OR gate combining both the
line level and the PEND register. With a latch for edge interrupts.

Have a look at Figure 4-10 ("Logic of the pending status of a
level-sensitive interrupt") in the GICv2 arch spec (ARM IHI 0048B.b)
to see what I actually mean.

Yes. It is *much* faster to read the timer status register (for
example) than going via an MMIO access to read the (re)distributor
that will return the same value.

Thanks,
