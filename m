As counter-intuitive as it sounds, it actually doesn't buy us if the CPUID
table is part of the PSP attestation report, since:

 - the boot stack is attested to, and if the boot stack isn't careful to
   use the CPUID table at all times, then attesting CPUID table after
   boot doesn't provide any assurance that the boot wasn't manipulated
   by CPUID
 - given the boot stack must take these precautions, guest-specific
   attestation code is just as capable of attesting the CPUID table
   contents/values, since it has the same view of the CPUID values that
   were used during boot.

So leaving it to the guest owner to attest it provides some flexibility
to guest owners to implement it as they see fit, whereas making it part
of the attestation report means that the guest needs the exact contents
of the CPUID page for a particular guest configuration so it can be
incorporated into the measurement they are expecting, which would likely
require some tooling provided by the cloud vendor, since every different
guest configuration, or even changes like the ordering in which entries
are placed in the table, would affect measurement, so it's not something
that could be easily surmised separately with minimal involvement from a
cloud vendor.

And even if the cloud vendor provided a simple way to export the table
contents for measurement, can you really trust it? If you have to audit
individual entries to be sure there's nothing fishy, why not just
incorporate those checks into the guest owner's attestation flow and
leave the vendor out of it completely?

So not including it in the measurement meshes well with the overall
SEV-SNP approach of reducing the cloud vendor's involvement in the
overall attestation process.

The thing here is that it's not just a specific CPUID page that's valid
for all guests for a particular host. Booting a guest with additional
vCPUs changes the contents, different CPU models/flags changes the
contents, etc. So it needs to be generated for each specific guest
configuration, and can't just be a read-only page.

Some sort of signature that indicates the PSP's stamp of approval on a
particular CPUID page would be nice, but we do sort of have this in the
sense that CPUID page 'address' is part of measurement, and can only
contain values that were blessed by the PSP. The problem then becomes
ensuring that only that address it used for CPUID lookups, and that it's
contents weren't manipulated in a way where it's 'valid' as far as the
PSP is concerned, but still not the 'expected' values for a particular
guest (which is where the attestation mentioned above would come into
play).

Yes, understandably so. But the only way to avoid that sort of weirdness
in general is for *all* guest state to be measured, all pages, all
registers, etc. Baking that directly into the SEV-SNP attestation report
would be a non-starter for most since computing the measurement for all
that state independently would require lots of additional inputs from
cloud vendor (who we don't necessarily trust in the first place), and
constant updates of measurement values since they would change with
every guest configuration change, every different starting TSC offset,
different, maybe the order in which vCPUs were onlined, stuff that the
kernel prints to log buffers, etc.

But, if a guest owner wants to attempt clever ways to account for some/all
of that in their attestation flow, they are welcome to try. That's sort of
the idea behind SNP attestation vs. SEV. Things like page
validation/encryption, cpuid enforcement, etc., reduce some of the
variables/possibilities guest owners need to account for during attestation
to make the process more secure/tenable, but they don't rule out all
possibilities, just as Trusted Boot doesn't necessarily mean you can fully
trust your OS state immediately afer boot; there are still outside
influences at play, and the boot stack should guard against them
wherever possible.

Exactly, moving attestation into the guest allows for more of the these
unexpected states to be accounted for at whatever level of paranoia a guest
owner sees fit, while still allowing firmware to provide some basic
assurances via attestation report and various features to reduce common
attack vectors during/after boot.
