OK, I will move enable_unrestricted_guestÂ  to loaded_vmcs.

I also see that enable_ept controls the setting of 
enable_unrestricted_guest. Perhaps both need to be moved to loaded_vmcs ?

About testing, I am thinking the test will first vmlaunch L2 in real 
mode or in protected mode, then vmexit on vmcall and then vmresume in 
the other mode. Is that how the test should flow ?
