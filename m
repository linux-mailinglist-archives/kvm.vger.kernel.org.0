#VEs trigger on RWX=0, but not misconfigurations, i.e. any and all
EPT_VIOLATION exits (reason 48) are convertible, and EPT_MISCONFIG exits
(reason 49) are never convertible.  The reasoning behind the logic is
that an EPT_MISCONFIG is the result of a VMM bug (or in KVM's case, MMIO
trickery), whereas a RWX=0 EPT_VIOLATION could be a malicious entity in
the guest probing non-existent pages or pages it doesn't have access to.
