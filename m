The "GIC virtual CPU interface" alone is slightly more than 4K: GICV_DIR
is at 0x1000. The documentation might need to be updated.

Are the "virtual CPU interface control" registers the ones starting with
GICH_? If yes, then I'm a bit confused, as those are not exposed to the
guest (to my knowledge).
