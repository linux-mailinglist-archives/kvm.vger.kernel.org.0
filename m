This is indeed the case. The ioctl will return -EBUSY if any vcpu is
running.

And I claim that this is wrong. It may suit a particular use case, but
that's definitely not a universal truth.

But what is there to get wrong? Absolutely nothing. Today, you can
save/restore a GICv3-ITS VM without a bitmap at all. Just dump all of
the memory. The bitmap only allows you to do it while the vcpus are
running. Do you want a dirty ring because it makes things faster?
Fine. But you need to understand what this does.

Yes, this may require some additional documentation. But more
importantly, it requires VMM authors to pay attention to what is
happening. At least the QEMU folks are doing that.

I don't think this makes any sense. Neither bitmap nor ring should be
a prerequisite for *anything*.
