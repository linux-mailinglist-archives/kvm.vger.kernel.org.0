The support was first added to x86 and then I ported it to arm and gave
porting it to arm64 a small effort too, but it didn't work off the bat.
I wrote it down on my TODO, but it eventually fell off the bottom...

On Fedora 36 with qemu-system-aarch64-6.2.0-17.fc36.x86_64 I have

PASS selftest-setup (2 tests)

SKIP micro-bench (test marked as manual run only)
PASS cache (1 tests)
PASS debug-bp (6 tests)
PASS debug-wp (8 tests)
FAIL debug-sstep (1 tests, 1 unexpected failures)

I had to drop all the migration tests from unittests.cfg since they were
hanging. The debug-sstep test passes with a later QEMU. Skipping the
psci test is for the same reason Nikos points out above. I diffed the
logs and besides EFI tests having edk2 output, they matched. I get the
same results with ACPI as DT, other than pci-test being skipped. I also
ran a couple tests from u-boot with bootefi and they worked.

Thanks,
drew
