It's a fully loaded vCPU, which yes to the host looks like spending a
very long time in the ioctl(KVM_RUN) syscall. I can reword to clarify.

I suppose the timeout is in kpatch then. I didn't check what implemented
the timeout. I'll remove the statement about timing out.

Thanks, I can update the commit message to include more of this
background.

xfer_to_guest_mode_work() is called as part of a loop to execute kvm
guests (for example, on x86 see vcpu_run() in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c). When
guest execution is interrupted (in the livepatch case it is interrupted
when set_notify_signal() is called for the vCPU task)
xfer_to_guest_mode_work() is called if there is pending work, and if it
returns non-zero the loop does not immediately re-enter guest execution
but instead returns to userspace.

What if the task's call stack contains a function being patched?

It does interrupt, but xfer_to_guest_mode_handle_work() concludes it's
not necessary to return to userspace and resumes guest execution.
