If nested_run_pending is not set, then nested entry can be aborted by
an event
(e.g another #SMI, or just an interrupt since after VM entry the
interrupts are usually enabled,
and interrupts are intercepted usually).

It is even possible for a nested migration to happen right after the
RSM is executed but before
actual VMENTER is executed.

There is a good explanation in commit 759cbd59674a and
commit=C2=A0e8efa4ff0037 that comes before it.

In a nutshell, there were two problems that together created
conditions for the guest boot failure:

1. When a non intercepted #SMI arrives while L2 is running, it's
almost like a VM exit from L2 to L1, however instead of restoring
the host state, KVM jumps to the SMI handler in real mode in L1.
Thus to be able later to run a regular VM exit handler, KVM stores
the host state (which is present in vmcb01) to HSAVE area and on RSM
restores it from HSAVE to vmcb01.
The bug was that KVM wasn't marking vmcb01 as dirty when restoring
the host state.
Usually this is not a problem because in this case we resume L2 and
thus switch to vmcb02.

2. Due to lack of setting the nested_run_pending, the above switch to
vmcb02 might not complete if there are pending events, which is allowed
because RSM doesn't have interrupt shadow, thus once we finished
emulating RSM, we are in the L2 guest and likely with interrupts
enabled.

If the switch to vmcb02 doesn't complete we end up still running
with vmcb01 and with lots of fields that were changed but not
marked as dirty.

Now usually this works because the CPU isn't that agressive in caching
vmcb fields, but if the whole thing is running nested under KVM,
then kvm always caches few 'rare' vmcb fields, like the IDTR, so
we end up with stale IDTR and on next interrupt the guest explodes.


PS: this is one of the mails that I forgot to send because I moved to
Canada recently and was offline for some time due to that.
