Hi Oliver,

Please Cc the KVM/arm64 reviewers (now added). Also, please consider
subscribing to the kvmarm mailing list so that I don't have to
manually approve your posts ;-).

Well, the current method has one huge advantage: time can never go
backward from the guest PoV if you restore what you have saved. Yes,
time can elapse, but you don't even need to migrate to observe that.

I'm not really in favour of inventing a completely new API, for
multiple reasons:

- CNTVOFF is an EL2 concept. I'd rather not expose it as such as it
  becomes really confusing with NV (which does expose its own CNTVOFF
  via the ONE_REG interface)

- You seem to allow each vcpu to get its own offset. I don't think
  that's right. The architecture defines that all PEs have the same
  view of the counters, and an EL1 guest should be given that
  illusion.

- by having a parallel save/restore interface, you make it harder to
  reason about what happens with concurrent calls to both interfaces

- the userspace API is already horribly bloated, and I'm not overly
  keen on adding more if we can avoid it.

I'd rather you extend the current ONE_REG interface and make it modal,
either allowing the restore of an absolute value or an offset for
CNTVCT_EL0. This would also keep a consistent behaviour when restoring
vcpus. The same logic would apply to the physical offset.

As for how to make it modal, we have plenty of bits left in the
ONE_REG encoding. Pick one, and make that a "relative" attribute. This
will result in some minor surgery in the get/set code paths, but at
least no entirely new mechanism.

One question though: how do you plan to reliably compute the offset?
As far as I can see, it is subject to the same issues you described
above (while the guest is being restored, time flies), and you have
the added risk of exposing a counter going backward from a guest
perspective.

Thanks,

	M.
