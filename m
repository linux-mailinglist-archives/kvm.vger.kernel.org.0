I think some script can utilize /proc/cpuinfo. For instance, admin can have
automation tool/script to deploy enclave (with sgx2) apps, and that script can check
whether platform supports sgx2 or not, before it can deploy those enclave apps.Â Or
enclave author may just want to check /proc/cpuinfo to know whether the machine can
be used for testing sgx2 enclave or not.

However this is just my 2 cents.

Thanks for the explaining. Will do.
