Hello Paul, Sean, sorry for the delay on this.

I tested x86 by counting cycles (using rdtsc_ordered()).

Cycles were counted upon function entry/exit on 
{svm,vmx}_vcpu_enter_exit(), and right before / after 
__{svm,vmx}_vcpu_run() in the same function.

The main idea was to get cycles spend in the procedures before entering 
guest (such as reporting RCU quiescent state in entry / exit) and the 
cycles actually used by the VM. 

Those cycles were summed-up and stored in per-cpu structures, with a 
counter to get the average value. I then created a debug file to read the 
results and reset the counters.

As for the VM, it got 20 vcpus, 8GB memory, and was booted with idle=poll.

The workload inside the VM consisted in cyclictest in 16 vcpus 
(SCHED_FIFO,p95), while maintaining it's main routine in 4 other cpus 
(SCHED_OTHER). This was made to somehow simulate busy and idle-er cpus. 

 $cyclictest -m -q -p95 --policy=fifo -D 1h -h60 -t 16 -a 4-19 -i 200 
  --mainaffinity 0-3

All tests were run for exaclty 1 hour, and the clock counter was reset at 
the same moment cyclictest stared. After that VM was poweroff from guest.
Results show the average for all CPUs in the same category, in cycles.

With above setup, I tested 2 use cases:
1 - Non-RT host, no CPU Isolation, no RCU patience (regular use-case)
2 - PREEMPT_RT host, with CPU Isolation for all vcpus (pinned), and 
    RCU patience = 1000ms (best case for RT)

Results are:
# Test case 1:
Vanilla: (average on all vcpus)
VM Cycles / RT vcpu:		123287.75 
VM Cycles / non-RT vcpu:	709847.25
Setup Cycles:			186.00
VM entries / RT vcpu:		58737094.81
VM entries / non-RT vcpu:	10527869.25
Total cycles in RT VM:		7241564260969.80
Total cycles in non-RT VM:	7473179035472.06

Patched: (average on all vcpus)
VM Cycles / RT vcpu:		124695.31        (+ 1.14%)
VM Cycles / non-RT vcpu:	710479.00        (+ 0.09%)
Setup Cycles:			218.65           (+17.55%)
VM entries / RT vcpu:		60654285.44      (+ 3.26%) 
VM entries / non-RT vcpu:	11003516.75      (+ 4.52%)
Total cycles in RT VM:		7563305077093.26 (+ 4.44%)
Total cycles in non-RT VM:	7817767577023.25 (+ 4.61%)

Discussion:
Setup cycles raised in ~33 cycles, increasing overhead.
It proves that noting a quiescent state in guest entry introduces setup 
routine costs, which is expected.

On the other hand, both the average time spend inside the VM and the number 
of VM entries raised, causing the VM to have ~4.5% more cpu cycles 
available to run, which is positive. Extra cycles probably came from not 
having invoke_rcu_core() getting ran after VM exit.


# Test case 2:

VM entries / non-RT vcpu:	11237660.50      (+ 0.41%)
Total cycles in RT VM:		7563685235393.27 (+ 0.01%)
Total cycles in non-RT VM:	7830674349667.13 (+ 0.13%)

Discussion:
Setup cycles raised in ~42 cycles, increasing overhead.
It proves that noting a quiescent state in guest entry introduces setup 
routine costs, which is expected.

The average time spend inside the VM was reduced, but the number of VM  
entries raised, causing the VM to have around the same number of cpu cycles 
available to run, meaning that the overhead caused by reporting RCU 
quiescent state in VM exit got absorbed, and it may have to do with those 
rare invoke_rcu_core()s that were bothering latency.

The difference is much smaller compared to case 1, and this is probably 
because there is a clause in rcu_pending() for isolated (nohz_full) cpus 
which may be already inhibiting a lot of invoke_rcu_core()s.

Sean, Paul, what do you think?

Thanks!
