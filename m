When context switch happens, perf code would schedule out the old events 
and schedule in the new events. When scheduling out, the ENABLE bit of 
EVENTSELx MSR would be cleared, and when scheduling in, the EVENTSELx 
and PMCx MSRs would be overwritten with new event's attr.config and 
sample_period separately.Â  Of course, these is only for the case when 
there are new events to be programmed on the PMC. If no new events, the 
PMCx MSR would keep stall value and won't be cleared.

Anyway, I don't see any reason that PMCx MSR must be cleared.
