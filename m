I've just pushed out a full branch at [1]. Please make sure to merge
kvmarm-fixes-6.18-3 in, as it fixes a couple of nasties (small
conflict expected, but the resolution should be obvious).

For my own testing, I added -rc6 on top.

Note that I didn't take your Tested-by: tags, as you are about to
retest the whole thing anyway. If all goes well (fingers crossed),
Oliver will be able to apply any further tag once I post these
patches.

Thanks,

	M.
