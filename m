So I went ahead and implemented some very basic FEAT_ECV support to
correctly emulate the timers (trapping the CTL/CVAL accesses).

Performance dropped like a rock (~30% extra overhead) for L2
exit-heavy workloads that are terminated in userspace, such as virtio.
For those workloads, vcpu_{load,put}() in L1 now generate extra traps,
as we save/restore the timer context, and this is enough to make
things visibly slower, even on a pretty fast machine.

I managed to get *some* performance back by satisfying CTL/CVAL reads
very early on the exit path (a pretty common theme with NV). Which
means we end-up needing something like what you have -- only a bit
more complete. I came up with the following:

diff --git a/arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c b/arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c

+	}
+
 	timer_ctx->irq.level = new_level;
 	trace_kvm_timer_update_irq(vcpu->vcpu_id, timer_ctx->irq.irq,
 				   timer_ctx->irq.level);

which reports the interrupt state in all cases.

Does this work for you?

Thanks,

	M.
