Yap.

So the CPUID page is supplied by the firmware, right?

Then, you parse it and see that the CPUID bit is 1, then you start using
the SEV_STATUS MSR and all good.

If there *is* a CPUID page but that bit is 0, then you can safely assume
that something is playing tricks on ya so you simply refuse booting.

Crash is a good thing in confidential computing. :)

So to me I wonder why would one use anything *else* but an SNP guest. We
all know that those previous technologies were just the stepping stones
towards SNP.

Well, I've always advocated having a best-practices writeup somewhere
goes a long way to explain this technology to people and how to get
their feet wet. And there you can give hints how such verification could
look like in detail...

There is Documentation/x86/amd-memory-encryption.rst, for example.
