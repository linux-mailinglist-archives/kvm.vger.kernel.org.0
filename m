Ok.

Yeah, that comes from git actually.

Actually, I'd like to avoid all such nasty games, if possible, with the
compressed kernel includes because this is where it leads us: sprinkling
defines left and right and all kinds of magic include order which is
fragile and error prone.

So please try to be very conservative here with all the including games.

So I'd like to understand first *why* asm/sev.h needs to have
__BOOT_COMPRESSED defined and can that be avoided? Maybe in a separate
mail because this one already deals with a bunch of things.

Ok, if we keep cpuid.h only strictly with cpuid-specific helpers, I
guess that's fine.

Yeah, and this is what I mean: efi.h includes a bunch of linux/
namespace headers and then we have to go deal with compressed
pulling all kinds of definitions from kernel proper, with hacks like
__BOOT_COMPRESSED, for example.

That EFI_CC_BLOB_GUID is only needed in the compressed kernel, right?
That is, if you move all the CC blob parsing to the compressed kernel
and supply the thusly parsed info to kernel proper. In that case, you
can simply define in there, in efi.c or so.

Thanks for explaining all that. What I mean here is to have some
reference above it to the official spec so that people can find it. With
SEV-*, there are a *lot* of specs so I'd like to have at least pointers
to the docs where one can find the text about it.

Yeah, first you need to kick Tom to send a new version. :-)

Yes, the skipping of checks above sounds weird: why don't you simply
keep the checks order: SEV, -ES, -SNP and then parse CPUID. It'll fail
at attestation eventually, but you'll have the usual flow like with the
rest of the SEV- feature picking apart.
