Absolutely. Thanks for the detailed context and walking through the 
different cases for each event type.

That's awesome. That's exactly what I want. Let me know if you are going 
to push that change or want me to work on it while revising this series.

I am happy to test those changes either way.

Agreed. I did not like this approach either and not sure if this is the 
best method to fix the problem we have. I should have clarified well 
that in the cover letter.

We do have an additional architecture specific issue at hand here.
As described, we need the event mapping with platforms with newer ISA 
extensions but doesn't need it for older platforms without ISA 
extensions. In addition to that, the new ISA extension doesn't cover 
virtualization. Thus, kvm guests continue to rely on the old way of 
discovering the events through SBI (ecall) interface.

Thus, a platform (e.g Qemu) can have both options present depending on
how it is configured.

To cover both cases, I introduced a RISC-V specific mechanism to detect 
the presence of the ISA extension in the perf tool.

"PATCH 18-20 adds hwprobe mechanism to enable perf to detect if platform 
supports delegation extensions."

If we don't want to keep any architecture specific hooks in this path, 
can we use a sysfs way to enable/disable mapping ?

I believe the pmu driver can update the sysfs for the perf tool to 
decide in that case ?

While that's ideal for x86/ARM64 where number of platform vendors are 
less (x86) or ISA has defined all-to-all event to counter mapping.

In RISC-V, we tried to push for all-to-all mapping which was not 
accepted withing RISC-V working groups. Every platform vendor will most 
likely end up in a different mapping of event to counters.

Thus, event to counter mapping via "Counter" field in json solve this
problem quite well. The only downside is that there is no common way 
across the architecture to pass that information to the pmu driver.

Hence a RISC-V specific solution via config2

Please let me know if this can be solved in an eficient way as well.

> However, the counters an event can go on is a property of the event so
> I see a need for the sysfs/json to add this.
