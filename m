Hey Stefan,

Thanks a lot for setting up GSoC this year again!

=== Implement -M nitro-enclave in QEMUÂ  ===

'''Summary:''' AWS EC2 provides the ability to create an isolated 
sibling VM context from within a VM. This project implements the machine 
model and input data format parsing needed to run these sibling VMs 
stand alone in QEMU.

Nitro Enclaves are the first widely adopted implementation of hypervisor 
assisted compute isolation. Similar to technologies like SGX, it allows 
to spawn a separate context that is inaccessible by the parent Operating 
System. This is implemented by "giving up" resources of the parent VM 
(CPU cores, memory) to the hypervisor which then spawns a second vmm to 
execute a completely separate virtual machine. That new VM only has a 
vsock communication channel to the parent and has a built-in lightweight 
TPM called NSM.

One big challenge with Nitro Enclaves is that due to its roots in 
security, there are very few debugging / introspection capabilities. 
That makes OS bringup, debugging and bootstrapping very difficult. 
Having a local dev&test environment that looks like an Enclave, but is 
100% controlled by the developer and introspectable would make life a 
lot easier for everyone working on them. It also may pave the way to see 
Nitro Enclaves adopted in VM environments outside of EC2.

This project will consist of adding a new machine model to QEMU that 
mimics a Nitro Enclave environment, including NSM, the vsock 
communication channel and building firmware which loads the special 
"EIF" file format which contains kernel, initramfs and metadata from a 
-kernel image.

If the student finishes early, we can then proceed to implement the 
Nitro Enclaves parent driver in QEMU as well to create a full QEMU-only 
Nitro Enclaves environment.

'''Tasks:'''
* Implement a device model for the NSM device (link to spec and driver 
code below)
* Implement a new machine model
* Implement firmware for the new machine model that implements EIF parsing
* Add tests for the NSM device
* Add integration test for the machine model executing an actual EIF payload
