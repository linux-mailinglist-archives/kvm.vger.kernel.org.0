IMO, the CPU behavior is a bug, even if the behavior is working as intended for
the microarchitecture.  I.e. this should be treated as an erratum.

There's a lot of "noise" in this intro.  That the CPU does additional checks at
VMRUN isn't all that interesting, what's relevant is that the CPU tags the
associated RMP entry with a special flag.  And IIUC, it does that for _all_ VMs,
not just SNP VMs.

Also, what happens if the pages aren't covered by the RMP?  Table 15-41 states
that the VMCB, AVIC, and VMSA for non-SNP guests need to be Hypervisor-Owned,
but doesn't explicitly require them to be RMP covered.  On the other hand, it
does state that the VMSA for an SNP guest must be Guest-Owned and RMP-Covered.
That implies that the Hypervisor-Owned pages do not need to contained within the
RMP, but how does that work if the CPU is setting a magic flag in the RMP?  Does
VMRUN explode?  Does the CPU corrupt random memory?

Is the in-use flag visible to software?  We've already established that "struct
rmpentry" is microarchitectural, so why not document it in the PPR?  It could be
useful info for debugging unexpected RMP violations, even if the flag isn't stable.

Are there other possible collisions with the in-use flag?  The APM states that
the in-use flag results in RMPUPDATE failing with FAIL_INUSE.  That's the same
error code that's returned if two CPUs attempt RMPUPDATE on the same entry.  That
implies that the RMPUPDATE also sets the in-use flag.  If that's true, then isn't
it possible that the spurious RMP violation #PF could happen if the kernel accesses
a hugepage at the same time a CPU is doing RMPUPDATE on the associated 2mb-aligned
entry?

Again, not that relevant since KVM isn't attempting to modify the RMP entry.
I've no objection to mentioning this behavior in passing, but it should not be
the focal point of the intro.

There's a critical piece missing here, which is why an RMP violation is thrown
on "in-use" pages.  E.g. are any translations problematic, or just writable
translations?  It may not affect the actual KVM workaround, but knowing exactly
what goes awry is important.

Please explicitly call out the relevance of the physmap.  IIUC, only the physmap,
a.k.a. direct map, is problematic because that's the only scenario where a large
page can overlap one of the magic pages.  That should be explicitly stated.

Be consistent with 2MB vs. 2M, i.e. choose one.

So what happens if the problematic page isn't 2mb aligned?  The lack of an RMP
violation on access implies that the hypervisor can bypass the in-use restriction
and create a 2mb hugepage, i.e. access the in-use page.  Same question for if the
TLB entry exists before the page is marked in-use, which also begs the question
of why the in-use flag is being checked at all on RMP lookups.

I know it's personal preference as to whether to lead with the solution or the
problem statement, but in this case it would be very helpful to at least provide
a brief summary early on so that the reader has some idea of where the changelog
is headed.  As is, the actual change is buried after a big pile of hardware
details.

E.g. something like this

  Implement a workaround for an SNP erratum where the CPU will incorrectly
  signal an RMP violation #PF if a hugepage (2mb or 1gb) collides with the
  RMP entry of a VMCB, VMSA, or AVIC backing page.

  When SEV-SNP is globally enabled, the CPU marks the VMCB, VMSA, and AVIC
  backing   pages as "in-use" in the RMP after a successful VMRUN.  This is
  done for _all_   VMs, not just SNP-Active VMs.

  If the hypervisor accesses an in-use page through a writable translation,
  the CPU will throw an RMP violation #PF.  On early SNP hardware, if an
  in-use page is 2mb aligned and software accesses any part of the associated
  2mb region with a hupage, the CPU will incorrectly treat the entire 2mb
  region as in-use and signal a spurious RMP violation #PF.

This isn't "finding" anything, it's identifying which of the two pages is
_guaranteed_ to be unaligned.  The whole function needs a much bigger comment to
explain what's going on.
