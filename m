Not sure what you mean there? A guest can query the PFN for either 
xenstore or console using HVM params, or it can find them in its own 
grant table entries 0 or 1.

I'm suggesting that the page be mapped in the same way that the xenstore 
backend does:

1462    /* 

1463     * We don't actually access the guest's page through the grant, 
because
1464     * this isn't real Xen, and we can just use the page we gave it 
in the
1465     * first place. Map the grant anyway, mostly for cosmetic 
purposes so
1466     * it *looks* like it's in use in the guest-visible grant table. 

1467     */
1468    s->gt = qemu_xen_gnttab_open();
1469    uint32_t xs_gntref = GNTTAB_RESERVED_XENSTORE;
1470    s->granted_xs = qemu_xen_gnttab_map_refs(s->gt, 1, xen_domid, 
&xs_gntref,
1471                                             PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE);

You're worried about the guest changing the page it uses for the primary 
console and putting a new one in xenstore? I'd be amazed if that even 
works on Xen unless the guest is careful to write it into 
GNTTAB_RESERVED_CONSOLE.

No, that doesn't entirely surprise me.
