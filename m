Ah, I missed this context.

Maybe -snapshot should error out if -blockdev is in use. You'd generally
expect that either -blockdev is used primarily and snapshots are done
externally (if the command line is generated by some management tool),
or that -drive is used consistently (by a human who likes the
convenience). In both cases, we wouldn't hit the error path.

There may be some exceptional cases where you have both -drive and
-blockdev (maybe because a human users needs more control for one
specific disk). This is the case where you can get a nasty surprise and
that would error out. If you legitimately want the -drive images
snapshotted, but not the -blockdev ones, you can still use individual
'-drive snapshot=on' options instead of the global '-snapshot' (and the
error message should mention this).

Would you see any problems with such an approach?

Kevin
