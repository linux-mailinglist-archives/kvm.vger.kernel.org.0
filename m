Basically we need to defer 'sgx_encl' related code from open to after mmap(). For
instance, We need to defer 'sgx_encl' allocation from open to SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_CREATE.
And due to this change, we also need to move some members out of 'sgx_encl', and use
them as common for enclave and vEPC. The 'struct xarray page_array' would be a good
example.

The code we can save, from my first glance, is just misc_register("/dev/sgx_vepc")
related, maybe plus some mmap() related code. The logic to handle both host enclave
and vEPC still needs to be there.

To me the major concern is /dev/sgx_enclave, by its name, implies it is associated
with host enclave. Adding IOCTL to *convert* it to vEPC is just mixing things up, and
is ugly.Â If we really want to do this, IMHO we need at least change /dev/sgx_enclave
to /dev/sgx_epc, for instance, to imply the fd we opened and mmap()'d just represents
some raw EPC. However this is changing to existing userspace ABI.

Sean,

What's your opinion? Did I miss anything?
