Well, that puts forward an important question: how do you verify
*reliably* that this is an SNP guest?

- attestation?

- CPUID?

- anything else?

I don't see this written down anywhere. Because this assumption will
guide the design in the kernel.

So what happens with that guest owner later?

How is she to notice that she booted unencrypted?

All this design needs to be preceded with: "We protect against cases A,
B and C and not against D, E, etc."

So that it is clear to all parties involved what we're working with and
what we're protecting against and what we're *not* protecting against.

End of mail 2, more later.
