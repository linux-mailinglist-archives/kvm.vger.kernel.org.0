Indeed, this doesn't look quite right.

Looking at the description of event 0x11, it doesn't seem to count
exactly like the cycle counter (there are a number of PMCR controls
affecting it). But none of these actually apply to our PMU emulation
(no secure mode, and the idea of dealing with virtual EL2 in the
context of the PMU is... not appealing).

Now, given that we implement the cycle counter with event 0x11 anyway,
I don't think there is any reason to deal with them separately.

I thought of that one, and couldn't see a reason to blacklist it
(after all, the guest could also increment a variable) and send itself
an interrupt. I'm tempted to simply document that event 0 is never
filtered.

Thanks,
