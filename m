Why should that be a requirement? Lazy populating of the VMA should be
perfectly acceptable if the fault can only happen on the CPU side.

I have the feeling this is an out-of-tree driver (and Santosh email
address is bouncing, so I guess we won't have much information from
him).

However, the simple fact that any odd driver can provide a fault
handler and populate it the VMA on demand makes me think that we need
to support this case.
