Yeah, past me owes current me a beer.

Yes, and as above, that assertion was more about the helper not really being safe
for general usage as opposed to wanting to detect use from preemptible context.
If we end up keeping the WARN_ON, I'll happily write a comment explaining the
point of the assertion.
