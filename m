Having a pesistent config written out & then purged later is still
problematic. If the host crashes, nothing will purge the config file,
so it will become a persistent device. Also when listing devices we
want to be able to report whether it is persistent or transient. The
obvious way todo that is to simply look if a config file exists or
not.

A global option is really not desirable, as it means that the behaviour
of the system that libvirt sees can silently change at any time. IMHO
this udev hook is  intermixing the two layers in the stack - keep the
low level sysfs layer completely separate from the higher level mgmt
concepts provided by this mdevctrl.

Thinking some more, the key tasks that libvirt needs to deal
with are

 1. Define a persistent config (Must not create any actual device)
 2. Undefine a persistent config (Must not delete any actual device)
 3. Create a device
 4. Delete a device
 5. Get list of all persistent configs
 6. Enable autostart of a device
 7. Disable autostart of a device

For 1, 2, 5, 6 & 7 libvirt doesn't really need a command line tool. As
long as there is a specification for the config file syntax and location
we can directly read/write/stat files. This would be much more efficient
and reliable for libvirt than spawning commands & parsing the output or
exit status.

For 3 & 4 we'd desire the command to accept a config file, either as a
file on disk for persistent devices, or inline on stdin for transient
devices.

I actually think the systemd integration is good, we just need to
make sure things are still doable without it. This could be as simple
as having an initscript that just iteates over the configs creating
each one at startup.
