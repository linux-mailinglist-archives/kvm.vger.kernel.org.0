Hello Paolo

I just remembered I once came across the patch, but I forgot it when
I wrote the mail.

It seems kvm_vcpu_check_breakpoint() handles only for code breakpoint
and doesn't handle for data breakpoints.

And no code handles DR7_GD bit when the emulation is not resulted from
vm-exit. (for example, the non-first instruction when kvm emulates
instructions back to back and the instruction accesses to DBn).

Thanks
Lai
