Ok, I will change it.

Ok, make sense.

In my opinion, logically it can work, but there might be problems like the
one below that I didn't notice...

Oh, thanks for pointing it out.
And if we always signal PTZ when alloc = 1, does it mean that we can't remap the
vPE when the VPT is not empty, thus there is no chance to get the VLPI state?
Could we just assume that the VPT is not empty when first mapping the vPE?
