Hello Dear.

I know that this letter may be a very big surprise to you, I came
across your email contact from my personal search and I believe that
you will be honest to fulfill my final wish before I will die. My name
is Mrs.Pam Amos dying woman who has decided to donate what I have to
you and the charity organization around your community.


I am 62 years
old and I was diagnosed for cancer for about 2years ago immediately
after the death of my husband who has left me everything he worked for
and because the doctors told me I will not live longer than some weeks
because of my health I decided to WILL/donate the sum of $10.5m to you
since I don't have a child. You should contact me immediately with
your Complete contact information?s so that I will put you in contact

with the establishment to enable you arrange with them on how to get
the money for the purpose mentioned above, I can't predict what will
be my fate by the time you will receive the fund, But you should
please ensure that the fund is used as l have described above.

Please reply back.
Best Regards,

Mrs. Pam Amos
