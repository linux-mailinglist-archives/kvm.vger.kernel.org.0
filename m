So this sounds like an unnecessary complication. I'm sure there are
reasons to do it this way but my simple thinking would simply want the
CPUID page to be read-only and signed so that the guest can trust it
unconditionally.

This sounds like the good practices advice to guest owners would be,
"Hey, I just booted your SNP guest but for full trust, you should go and
verify the CPUID page's contents."

"And if I were you, I wouldn't want to run any verification of CPUID
pages' contents on the same guest because it itself hasn't been verified
yet."

It all sounds weird.

Yah, I guess the kernel can do good enough verification and then the
full thing needs to be done by the guest owner and in *some* userspace
- not necessarily on the currently booted, unverified guest - but
somewhere, where you have maximal flexibility.

IMHO.
