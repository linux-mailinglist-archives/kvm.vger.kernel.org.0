For my own enlightenment, could you describe a sequence of events that
leads to this issue?

I guess my confusion stems from my (probably wrong) interpretation if
the SS state is A+P, there is no harm in making it pending again
(setting the SS bit in PSTATE).

But it looks like the *pending* state is actually stored in MDSCR
instead? The spec only mentions this for the A+P state, so this is
quite likely a bug indeed.

Now, where does the asynchronous exception comes into play? I found
this intriguing remark in the ARM ARM:

<quote>
The Software Step exception has higher priority than all other types
of synchronous exception. However, the prioritization of this
exception with respect to any unmasked pending asynchronous exception
is not defined by the architecture.
</quote>

Is this what you were referring to in the commit message? I think you
need to spell it out for us, as I don't fully understand what you are
fixing nor do I understand the gory details of single-stepping...

Thanks,

	M.
