Yep, it looks like an option. Maybe we can have
     -M nitro-enclave,vhost-user-vsock=char0

IMHO the new option should be part of the --vm group (please avoid short 
options) in conflict with `uds-path`. We may also need a parameter, e.g.  
the CID where forward them.
Something like this:
     --vm guest-cid=5,forward-cid=1,socket=/tmp/vhost5.socket

>guest-cid=5,socket=/tmp/vhost5.socket,uds-path=/tmp/vm5.vsock"

Yep.

Right.

Nope, the "socat" work should be done by the vhost-device-vsock daemon.

I think you're right.

Nope, if you know in advance which ports to expose, you can add another 
parameter to expose them, so the daemon con listen on the address 
(cid=1, port=1234) and forwards the connections to the guest.
