For now, they are not publicly available. Once the refs are available =

(e.g. AWS documentation, GitHub documentation), I'll include them in the =

kernel documentation as well.

As a note here, the NE project is currently in preview =

(https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/) and part of the =

documentation / codebase will be publicly available when NE is generally =

available (GA). This will be in addition to the ones already publicly =

available, like the NE kernel driver.

Let me know if I can help with any particular questions / clarifications.

Thanks,
Andra
