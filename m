The only reason for this comment is other guest state tests currently do 
not have such elaborate comments.
But I am fine either way.

As you said, the current implementation allows a guest executable to be 
set only once for each of the entries in 'vmx_tests' array. Hence 
sub-tests can not setup their own guest.

Now, the sub-tests (including future additions) within 
'vmx_guest_state_area_test' are complete and independent tests on their 
own. The only reason for grouping them under 'vmx_guest_state_area_test' 
is to organize them in a nice hierarchical fashion.

May be, a better solution is to remove the restriction in 
test_set_guest() and let each test/sub-test set it's own guest. This 
will also mean that test_set_guest() should set GUEST_RIP as well.
