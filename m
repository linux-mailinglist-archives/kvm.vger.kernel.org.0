Thanks for having a go at this, and identifying the case where it
actually matters (I would have hoped that the original reporter would
have helped with this, but hey, never mind). The results are pretty
impressive (more so than I anticipated), and I wonder whether we could
improve things further (50k interrupts/s is not that high -- I get
more than 100k on some machines just by playing with their sdcard...).

Could you describe how many interrupt sources each device has? The
reason I'm asking is that the cache size is pretty much hardcoded at
the moment (4 entries per vcpu), and that could have an impact on
performance if we keep evicting entries in the cache (note to self:
add some statistics for that).

Another area where we can improve things is that I think the
invalidation mechanism is pretty trigger happy (MOVI really doesn't
need to invalidate the cache). On the other hand, I'm not sure your
guest does too much of that.

Finally, the single cache spin-lock is bound to be a bottleneck of its
own at high interrupt rates, and I wonder whether we should move the
whole thing over to an RCU friendly data structure (the vgic_irq
structure really isn't that friendly). It'd be good to find out how
contended that spinlock is on your system.

Another useful data point would be the delta with bare-metal: how much
overhead do we have with KVM, with and without this patch series. Oh,
and for easier comparison, please write it as a table that we can dump
in the cover letter when I actually post the series! ;-)

Thanks,

	M.
