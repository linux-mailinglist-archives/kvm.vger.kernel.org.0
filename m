Well, let's see:

$ make oldconfig
...

#
# No change to .config
#
$

So it didn't even ask me. Because

# CONFIG_VIRT_DRIVERS is not set

so what's the point of this "default y"?

If the distros are your worry, then you probably will have to ask
them to do so explicitly anyway because at least we edit our configs
ourselves and decide what to enable or what not.

Well, but you need to explain that somewhere to the guest owners.
I guess either here in that error message or in some higher-level
glue which will do the attestation. Just saying that some counter has
overflown is not very user-friendly, I'd say.

So you need to rename that mutex and slap a comment above it what it
protects.

Thx.
