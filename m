This is what I did, and saved you the hassle of looking it up.

It's not so much about making a silly mistake. I do that all the time.
But it is about the way you state these things, and the weight that
your reviews carry. You're a trusted reviewer, with a lot of
experience, and posting with an @arm.com address: what you say in a
public forum sticks. When you assert that the author is wrong, they
will take it at face value.

What is the worse: no review? or a review that spreads confusion?
Think about it. I'm all for being nice, but I will call bullshit when
I see it asserted by people with a certain level of authority.

And I've long made up my mind about the state of the KVM/arm64 review
process -- reviews rarely come from people who have volunteered to do
so, but instead from those who have either a vested interest in it, or
an ulterior motive. Hey ho...
