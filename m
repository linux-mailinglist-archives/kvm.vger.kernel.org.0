Well the current model I am working with has us using MAD_DONTNEED from
the hypervisor if the unsued page is reported. So it will still have to be
pulled back in, but it will start out as a zeroed page.

So the fault I was referring to would be inside the guest only. Basically
we would keep the page for a little while longer while it is inactive and
just let the mapping go. Then if something accesses it before we finally
release it we don't pay the heavy cost of having to get it back from the
host and then copying the memory back in from swap or the file.

I'm just loosely basing that on the "proactive reclaim" idea that was
proposed back at the last lsf/mm summit (https://lwn.net/Articles/787611/)
. I still haven't even started work on any of those pieces yet nor looked
at it too closely. I'm still in the information gathering phase.

Okay, sounds good.
