I really don't think so.

KVM currently restricts the vcpu features to be unified across vcpus,
but that's only an implementation choice. The ARM architecture doesn't
mandate that these registers are all the same, and it isn't impossible
that we'd allow for the feature set to become per-vcpu at some point
in time. So this argument doesn't really hold.

Furthermore, compatibility with QEMU's save/restore model is
essential, and AFAICT, there is no open source alternative.

Cleaner? Why? How? You'd have the exact same constraints, plus the
disadvantages of having to maintain a new interface concurrently with
the existing ones.

What is the problem with immutability on first run? Or even with a
'finalize' ioctl (we already have one)?

A device means yet another configuration and migration API. Don't you
think we have enough of those? The complexity of KVM/arm64 userspace
API is already insane, and extremely fragile. Adding to it will be a
validation nightmare (it already is, and I don't see anyone actively
helping with it).

So no, I have no plan to consider anything but the GET/SET_ONE_REG
interface, and until someone writes another open source VMM that has
the same save/restore capabilities and proves that this interface
isn't fit for purpose, I see no incentive in deviating from a model
that is known to work.

Thanks,

	M.
