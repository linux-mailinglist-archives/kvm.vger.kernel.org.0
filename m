Subject: [PATCH RESEND v23 00/10] Add ARMv8 RAS virtualization support in QEMU
Date:   Mon, 17 Feb 2020 09:27:27 +0800

In the ARMv8 platform, the CPU error types includes synchronous external abort(SEA)
and SError Interrupt (SEI). If exception happens in guest, host does not know the
detailed information of guest, so it is expected that guest can do the recovery.
For example, if an exception happens in a guest user-space application, host does
not know which application encounters errors, only guest knows it.

For the ARMv8 SEA/SEI, KVM or host kernel delivers SIGBUS to notify userspace.
After user space gets the notification, it will record the CPER into guest GHES
buffer and inject an exception or IRQ to guest.

In the current implementation, if the type of SIGBUS is BUS_MCEERR_AR, we will
treat it as a synchronous exception, and notify guest with ARMv8 SEA
notification type after recording CPER into guest.

A) This series of patches are based on Qemu 4.2, which include two parts:
1. Generate APEI/GHES table.
2. Handle the SIGBUS signal, record the CPER in runtime and fill it into guest
   memory, then notify guest according to the type of SIGBUS.

B) The solution was suggested by James(james.morse@arm.com); The APEI part solution was suggested by Laszlo(lersek@redhat.com). Show some discussions in [1].

C) This series of patches have already been tested on ARM64 platform with RAS
feature enabled:
1. Show the APEI part verification result in [2].
2. Show the SIGBUS of BUS_MCEERR_AR handling verification result in [3].

D) Add 'ras' option in command Line to enable guest RAS error recovery feature, For example:
KVM model: ./qemu-system-aarch64 --enable-kvm -cpu host --bios QEMU_EFI.fd_new  -machine virt,gic-version=3,ras,kernel-irqchip=on  -smp 4 -nographic -kernel Image  -append "rdinit=/init console=ttyAMA0 mem=512M root=/dev/ram0" -initrd guestfs_new.cpio.gz
TCG model: ./qemu-system-aarch64 -cpu cortex-a57 --bios QEMU_EFI.fd_new  -machine virt,gic-version=3,ras,kernel-irqchip=on  -smp 4 -nographic -kernel Image  -append "rdinit=/init console=ttyAMA0 mem=512M root=/dev/ram0" -initrd guestfs_new.cpio.gz

Note: the UEFI(QEMU_EFI.fd) is needed if guest want to use ACPI table.

After guest boot up, dump the APEI table, then can see the initialized table

(2) # cat HEST.dsl

(3) After a synchronous external abort(SEA) happen, Qemu receive a SIGBUS and 
    filled the CPER into guest GHES memory.  For example, according to above table,
    the address that contains the physical address of a block of memory that holds
    the error status data is 0x00000000785D0040
(4) the address of error source which is SEA notification type is 0x785d80b0
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0040
    00000000785d0040: 0x785d80b0

(5) check the content of generic error status block and generic error data entry
    (qemu) xp /100x 0x785d80b0
    00000000785d80b0: 0x00000001 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000098

    00000000785d80e0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d80f0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d8100: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00004002
(6) check the OSPM's ACK value(for example SEA)
    /* Before OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000000

    /* After OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value, it change to 1 from 0 */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000001

[3]: KVM deliver "BUS_MCEERR_AR" to Qemu, Qemu record the guest CPER and inject
    synchronous external abort to notify guest, then guest do the recovery.
