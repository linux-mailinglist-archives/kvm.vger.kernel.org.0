It's in ARM DDI 0487E.a, table D5-33, footnote c: "Not executable, because
AArch64 execution treats all regions writable at EL0 as being PXN". I'll update
the comment to include the quote.

I was following the pattern from lib/arm/mmu.c. You are correct, and Linux
doesn't do any dcache maintenance either (judging by looking at both set_pte
(for arm64) and various implementations for set_pte_ext (for armv7)).

For future reference, ARM DDI 0487E.a, in section D13.2.72, states about the
ID_MMFR3_EL1 register:

"CohWalk, bits [23:20]

Coherent Walk. Indicates whether Translation table updates require a clean to
the Point of Unification. Defined values are:
0b0000 Updates to the translation tables require a clean to the Point of
Unification to ensure visibility by subsequent translation table walks.
0b0001 Updates to the translation tables do not require a clean to the Point of
Unification to ensure visibility by subsequent translation table walks.

In Armv8-A the only permitted value is 0b0001."

For armv7, ARM DDI 0406C.d states in section B3.3.1 Translation table walks:

"If an implementation includes the Multiprocessing Extensions, translation table
walks must access data or unified caches, or data and unified caches, of other
agents participating in the coherency protocol, according to the shareability
attributes described in theÂ  TTBR. These shareability attributes must be
consistent with the shareability attributes for the translation tables themselves."

and in section B1.7 that virtualization extensions require the multiprocessing
extensions.

So the dcache maintenance operations are not needed, I'll remove them, thank you
for pointing this out.

Thanks,
Alex
