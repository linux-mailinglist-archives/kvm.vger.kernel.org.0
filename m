There are two ways that I see to fix this:

- Have the caller wait for however long it sees fit, and *after* that waiting
period call wait_for_interrupts().

- Pass a flag to wait_for_interrupts() to specify that the behaviour should be to
wait for the entire duration instead of until the expected interrupts have been
received.

Neither sounds appealing to me for inclusion in this patch set, since I want to
concentrate on reworking check_acked() while keeping much of the current behaviour
intact.

I don't think it really matters where the 100 millisecond delay is in the loop. If
we call wait_for_interrupts() to actually check that interrupts have fired (as
opposed to checking that they haven't been asserted), then at most we save 100ms
when they are asserted before the start of the loop. I don't think the GIC spec
guarantees that interrupts written to the LR registers will be presented to the
CPU after the guest resumes, so it is conceivable that there might be a delay,
thus ending up in waiting the extra 100ms even if the delay is at the end of the loop.

There are two reasons I chose the approach of having the delay at the start of the
loop:

1. To preserve the current behaviour.

2. To match what the timer test those (see gic_timer_check_state()). I am also
thinking that maybe at some point we could unify these test-independent functions
in the gic driver.

As for the 5 seconds delay, I think we can come up with a patch to pass the delay
as a parameter to the function if needed (if I remember correctly, you needed a
shorter waiting period for your GIC tests).

Yes, I would rather make this changes when we have an actual test that needs them.

I'm not sure moving it into the caller is the right thing to do. This is something
that has to do with how interrupts are asserted, not something that is specific to
one test.

You are right about the comment, I'll add one.
