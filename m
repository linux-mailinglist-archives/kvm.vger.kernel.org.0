Subject: [PATCH v5 0/8] KVM/ARM: Some vgic fixes and init sequence KVM selftests
Date:   Sun,  4 Apr 2021 19:22:35 +0200
Message-Id: <20210404172243.504309-1-eric.auger@redhat.com>

While writting vgic v3 init sequence KVM selftests I noticed some
relatively minor issues. This was also the opportunity to try to
fix the issue laterly reported by Zenghui, related to the RDIST_TYPER
last bit emulation. The final patch is a first batch of VGIC init
sequence selftests. Of course they can be augmented with a lot more
register access tests, but let's try to move forward incrementally ...

Best Regards

Eric

This series can be found at:
https://github.com/eauger/linux/tree/vgic_kvmselftests_v5

History:
v4 -> v5:
- rewrite the last bit detection according to Marc's
  interpretation of the spec and modify the kvm selftests
  accordingly
v3 -> v4:
- take into account Drew's comment on the kvm selftests. No
  change to the KVM related patches compared to v3
v2 ->v3:
- reworked last bit read accessor to handle contiguous redist
  regions and rdist not registered in ascending order
- removed [PATCH 5/9] KVM: arm: move has_run_once after the
  map_resources
v1 -> v2:
- Took into account all comments from Marc and Alexandru's except
  the has_run_once still after the map_resources (this would oblige
  me to revisit in depth the selftests)
