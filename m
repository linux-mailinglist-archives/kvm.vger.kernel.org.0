No argument there, and we're certainly not tied to any specific
mechanism on the pKVM side. Maybe Sean can chime in, but we've
definitely spoken about migration being a goal in the past, so I guess
something changed since then on the guest_memfd side.

Regardless, from our point of view, we just need to make sure that
whatever we settle on for pKVM does the things we need it to do (or can
at least be extended to do them) and we're happy to implement that in
whatever way works best for upstream, guest_memfd or otherwise.

Are the prototypes you refer to here based on the old stuff from Kirill?
We followed that work at the time, thinking we were going to be using
that before guest_memfd came along, so we've sadly been collecting
out-of-tree patches for a little while :/

Slight aside and not wanting to derail the discussion, but we have a few
different types of sharing which we'll have to consider:

  * Memory shared from the host to the guest. This remains owned by the
    host and the normal mm stuff can be made to work with it.

  * Memory shared from the guest to the host. This remains owned by the
    guest, so there's a pin on the pages and the normal mm stuff can't
    work without co-operation from the guest (see next point).

  * Memory relinquished from the guest to the host. This actually unmaps
    the pages from the host and transfers ownership back to the host,
    after which the pin is dropped and the normal mm stuff can work. We
    use this to implement ballooning.

I suppose the main thing is that the architecture backend can deal with
these states, so the core code shouldn't really care as long as it's
aware that shared memory may be pinned.

Yes, and we'd also need a way to establish hugepages (where possible)
even for the *private* memory so as to reduce the depth of the guest's
stage-2 walk.

I agree on all of these and, yes, (3) is the problem for us. We've also
been thinking a bit about CoW recently and I suspect the use of
vm_normal_page() in do_wp_page() could lead to issues similar to those
we hit with GUP. There are various ways to approach that, but I'm not
sure what's best.

It's not impossible. We use crosvm as our VMM, and that has a
multi-process sandbox mode which I think relies on just that...

Cheers,

Will

(btw: I'm getting some time away from the computer over Easter, so I'll be
 a little slow on email again. Nothing personal!).
