So I went ahead and gave QEMU a go. On my systems, *nothing* works (I
cannot even boot a L1 with 'virtualization=on" (the guest is stuck at
the point where virtio gets probed and waits for its first interrupt).

Worse, booting a hVHE guest results in QEMU generating an assert as it
tries to inject an interrupt using the QEMU GICv3 model, something
that should *NEVER* be in use with KVM.

With help from Eric, I got to a point where the hVHE guest could boot
as long as I kept injecting console interrupts, which is again a
symptom of the vGIC not being used.

So something is *majorly* wrong with the QEMU patches. I don't know
what makes it possible for you to even boot the L1 - if the GIC is
external, injecting an interrupt in the L2 is simply impossible.

Miguel, can you please investigate this?

In the meantime, I'll add some code to the kernel side to refuse the
external interrupt controller configuration with NV. Hopefully that
will lead to some clues about what is going on.

Thanks,

	M.
