The VGIC implementation is completely unaware of the existence of UFFD,
which is rather elegant.

There is no ioctl that allows userspace to directly get/set the VGIC
state. Instead, when userspace wants to migrate a VM it needs to flush
the cached state out of KVM's representation into guest memory. I would
expect the VMM to do this right before collecting the final dirty
bitmap.

If UFFD is off the table then it would appear there are two options:

 - Instrument these ioctls to request pages not marked as present in the
   theorized KVM-owned demand paging interface

 - Mandate that userspace has transferred all of the required VGIC / ITS
   pages before resuming on the target

The former increases the maintenance burden of supporting post-copy
upstream and the latter *will* fail spectacularly. Ideally we use a
mechanism that doesn't require us to think about instrumenting
post-copy for every new widget that we will want to virtualize.

Who do we expect to look after the upstreamed short-term solution once
Google has moved on to something else?
