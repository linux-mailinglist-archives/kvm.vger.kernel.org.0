I thought there was a request to make this more specific to migration
by renaming it to something like migration_version.  Also, as an
optional attribute, it seems the example should perhaps not add it to
all types to illustrate that it is not required.

Can the user assume the data contents of the string is ascii
characters?  It's good that the vendor driver defines the format and
length, but the user probably needs some expectation bounding that
length.  Should we define it as no larger than PATH_MAX (4096), or maybe
NAME_MAX (255) might be more reasonable?

Compatible for what purpose?  I think this is where specifically
calling this a migration_version potentially has value.

IOW, the write(2) will succeed if the version is determined to be
compatible and otherwise fail with vendor specific errno.

Is this intended to support that the vendor driver can supply a version
attribute but not support migration?  TBH, this sounds like a vendor
driver bug, but maybe it's necessary if the vendor driver could have
some types that support migration and others that do not?  IOW, we're
supplying the same attribute groups to all devices from a vendor, in
which case my comment above regarding an example type without a version
attribute might be invalid.

I think it's best not to define the specific errno returned for a
specific situation, let the vendor driver decide, userspace simply
needs to know that an errno on read indicates the device does not
support migration version comparison and that an errno on write
indicates the devices are incompatible or the target doesn't support
migration versions.

Is this really the version information exposed in 2/2?  This is opaque,
so of course you can add things later, but it seems short sighted not
to even append a version 0 tag to account for software compatibility
differences since the above only represents a parent and mdev type
based version.

TBH, there's a lot of superfluous information in this example that can
be stripped out.  For example:

"
(1) Compare mdev types:

The mdev type of an instantiated device can be read from the mdev_type
link within the device instance in sysfs, for example:

  # basename $(readlink -f /sys/bus/mdev/devices/$MDEV_UUID/mdev_type/)

The mdev types available on a given host system can also be found
through /sys/class/mdev_bus, for example:

  # ls /sys/class/mdev_bus/*/mdev_supported_types/

Migration is only possible between devices of the same mdev type.

(2) Retrieve the mdev source version:

The migration version information can either be read from the mdev_type
link on an instantiated device:

  # cat /sys/bus/mdev/devices/$UUID1/mdev_type/version

Or it can be read from the mdev type definition, for example:

  # cat /sys/class/mdev_bus/*/mdev_supported_types/$MDEV_TYPE/version

If reading the source version generates an error, migration is not
possible.  NB, there might be several parent devices for a given mdev
type on a host system, each may support or expose different versions.
Matching the specific mdev type to a parent may become important in
such configurations.

(3) Test source version at target:

Given a version as outlined above, its compatibility to an instantiated
device of the same mdev type can be tested as:

  # echo $VERSION > /sys/bus/mdev/devices/$UUID2/mdev_type/version

If this write fails, the source and target versions are not compatible
or the target does not support migration.

Compatibility can also be tested prior to target device creation using
the mdev type definition for a parent device with a previously found
matching mdev type, for example:

  # echo $VERSION > /sys/class/mdev_bus/$PARENT/mdev_supported_types/$MDEV_TYPE/version

Again, an error writing the version indicates that an instance of this
mdev type would not support a migration from the provided version.
"

In particular from the provided example, the specific UUIDs, mdev
types, parent information, and contents of the version attribute do not
contribute to illustrating the protocol.  In fact, displaying the
contents of the version attribute may tempt users to do comparison on
their own, especially given how easy it is to decide the GVT-g version
string.
