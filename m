Subject: [PATCH RESEND v3 0/3] KVM: x86: Enable user wait instructions
Date:   Sun, 16 Jun 2019 17:55:52 +0800

UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE are a set of user wait instructions.

UMONITOR arms address monitoring hardware using an address. A store
to an address within the specified address range triggers the
monitoring hardware to wake up the processor waiting in umwait.

UMWAIT instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state while monitoring a range of addresses. The optimized
state may be either a light-weight power/performance optimized state
(c0.1 state) or an improved power/performance optimized state
(c0.2 state).

TPAUSE instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state c0.1 or c0.2 state and wake up when time-stamp counter
reaches specified timeout.

Availability of the user wait instructions is indicated by the presence
of the CPUID feature flag WAITPKG CPUID.0x07.0x0:ECX[5].

The patches enable the umonitor, umwait and tpause features in KVM.
Because umwait and tpause can put a (psysical) CPU into a power saving
state, by default we dont't expose it to kvm and enable it only when
guest CPUID has it. If the instruction causes a delay, the amount
of time delayed is called here the physical delay. The physical delay is
first computed by determining the virtual delay (the time to delay
relative to the VMâ€™s timestamp counter).

This patch has a dependency on https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/7/1206

Changelog:
v3:
	Simplify the patches, expose user wait instructions when the
	guest has CPUID (Paolo)
	Use mwait_control_cached to avoid frequently rdmsr of
	IA32_UMWAIT_CONTROL (Paolo and Xiaoyao)
	Handle vm-exit for UMWAIT and TPAUSE as "never happen" (Paolo)
v2:
	Separated from the series https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/7/10/160
	Add provide a capability to enable UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE 
v1:
	Sent out with MOVDIRI/MOVDIR64B instructions patches
