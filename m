Ah, that makes total sense - detecting queue presence by non-zero
queue size sounds good to me, and it should work in the normal virtio
device case.

I am not sure about vhost-user, since there is no way for the
front-end to ask the back-end for a queue's size; the confusingly
named VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_NUM allows the front-end to configure the
size of a queue, but there's no corresponding GET message.

Got it, that sounds reasonable to me given the explanation above.
