What a pity. Maybe we can enable amperf for AMD guests as well as

I don't think slow-path-always is a good option for enablment and we could

In principle I strongly agree.

It's true and I have to rework this part.

With hwp.msrs[mperf] reset to 0, it is hard to emulate the current
value of hwp.msrs[aperf] and the value of aperf counter remaining.

How about we assume that this aperf counter increases uniformly
between the two calls to the get_host_amperf() ?

Please note AMD doesn't have this kind of interlocking.

For fast-path, I have reproduced this with the pCPU oversubscription condition.

I'm not sure we can make it work completely,
or have to make it a restriction on the use of this feature.

If you find any more design flaws, please let me know.
