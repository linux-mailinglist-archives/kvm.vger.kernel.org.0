No worries. There is nothing like "nerd sniping"... ;-)

Nah, G2/G3 are old stuff (v8.2 and v8.3+ respectively). You need at
least a v8.6 system, something that is made of the best Unobtainium
money can buy. M2 has ECV, but without CNTPOFF, which is just silly.

Thanks a lot, that'd be super helpful. Please don't get too attached
to the userspace interface though, as it is likely to change (Oliver
has an interesting suggestion to simplify it, but I need to convince
myself that it doesn't break migration of the physical timer).

Thanks,

	M.

Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.
