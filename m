As mentioned above on the "Address Space Resource Descriptors", Linux kernel
currently doesn't use any other information when do the remap for Operation
Region.

If we expect the memory attribute typeÂ  in "Address Space Resource Descriptors"
to be used, it requires Linux kernel code change, and IMO this would be too
complicated.

You can see the handler used for different space_id types in
acpi_ev_install_space_handler().

- For ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_MEMORY, the handler is
 Â  acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler(), which will remap the operation region
 Â  before the ACPI method _STA accessing the fields inside the operation region.

- For ACPI_ADR_SPACE_PCI_CONFIG, the handler is
 Â  acpi_ex_pci_config_space_handler(), PIO read/write is used when the offset
 Â  is within 256 bytes.

I am curious how this could work by providing a fake PCI config space information.

Anyway, I don't think it's the right way.

This may have some side effect on performance though.
See the commit 6d5bbf00d251, the reason why ACPI code use ioremap_cache():
 Â  Â  ACPI: Use ioremap_cache()

 Â  Â  Although the temporary boot-time ACPI table mappings
 Â  Â  were set up with CPU caching enabled, the permanent table
 Â  Â  mappings and AML run-time region memory accesses were
 Â  Â  set up with ioremap(), which on x86 is a synonym for
 Â  Â  ioremap_nocache().

 Â  Â  Changing this to ioremap_cache() improves performance as
 Â  Â  seen when accessing the tables via acpidump,
 Â  Â  or /sys/firmware/acpi/tables. It should also improve
 Â  Â  AML run-time performance.
