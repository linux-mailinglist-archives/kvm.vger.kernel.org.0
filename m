OK. How about:

	/*
	 * Compatibility checks are done when loading KVM or in KVM's CPU
	 * hotplug callback. It ensures all online CPUs are compatible before
	 * running any vCPUs. For other cases, compatibility checks are
	 * unnecessary or even problematic. Try to detect improper usages here.
	 */
	WARN_ON(!irqs_disabled() && !cpu_active(smp_processor_id()));

a CPU is active when it reaches the CPUHP_AP_ACTIVE state (the last state before
CPUHP_ONLINE). So, if a cpu isn't active, it probably is being hotplugged. One
false positive is the CPU is dying, which I guess is fine.

And to help justify this change, I will merge it into patch 6.
