Thanks for your attention.
Indeed, this series wasÂ  more or less based on the patches I post before 
(Link: 
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210114121350.123684-4-wangyanan55@huawei.com).
And they have already been merged into up-to-data upstream master 
(commit: 509552e65ae8287178a5cdea2d734dcd2d6380ab), but not into tags 
v5.11-rc1 to v5.11-rc7.
Could you please try the newest upstream master(since commit: 
509552e65ae8287178a5cdea2d734dcd2d6380ab) ? I have tested on my local 
and no apply errors occur.

Thanks,

Yanan.
