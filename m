Why does closing the socket require destroying the kvmi object?  E.g. can
it be marked as defunct or whatever and only fully removed on a synchronous
unhook from userspace?  Re-hooking could either require said unhook, or
maybe reuse the existing kvmi object with a new socket.

By event loop, do you mean the per-vCPU jobs list?
