I kept the allocator in lib because I thought that RISC-V might have an use
for it. Since it's a RISC architecture, I was thinking that it also might
require software cache management around enabling/disabling the MMU. But in
the end it's up to you, it would be easy to move the physical allocator to
lib/arm if you think that is best.

I will write a comment explaining the baked in assumptions for the
allocator.

The architecture mandates that load-acquire/store-release instructions are
supported only on Normal memory (to be more precise, Inner Shareable, Inner
Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Normal memory with Read allocation hints and
Write allocation hints and not transient and Outer Shareable, Inner
Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Normal memory with Read allocation hints and
Write allocation hints and not transient, ARM DDI 0487H.a, pages B2-211 and
B2-212).

If the AUXINFO_MMU_OFF flag is set, kvm-unit-tests doesn't enable the MMU
at boot, which means that all tests can be run with the MMU disabled. In
this case, all memory is Device-nGnRnE (instead of Normal). By using an
implementation that doesn't take into account that spin_lock() might be
called with the MMU disabled, kvm-unit-tests will end up using exclusive
access instructions on memory which doesn't support it. This can have
various effects, all rather unpleasant, like causing an external abort or
treating the exclusive access instruction as a NOP (ARM DDI 0487H.a, page
B2-212).

Tested this on my rockpro64 board, kvm-unit-tests built from current
master, with the mmu_disabled() path removed from spin_lock() (and
AUXINFO_MMU_OFF flag set), all tests hang indefinitely, that's because
phys_alloc_init() uses a spinlock. It is conceivable that we could rework
the setup code to remove the usage of spinlocks, but it's still the matter
of tests needing one for synchronization. It's also the matter of the uart
needing one for puts. And report. And probably other places.

Out of curiosity, without setting the AUXINFO_MMU_OFF flag, I tried using
the generic version of the spinlock (I assume you mean the one from
lib/asm-generic/spinlock.h, changed lib/arm64/asm/spinlock.h to include the
above header), selftest-setup hangs without displaying anything before
phys_alloc_init(), I have no idea why that is.

In the current implementation, when AUXINFO_MMU_OFF is set, tests that
actually use more than one thread might end up being incorrect some of the
time because spin_lock() doesn't protect against concurrent accesses.
That's pretty bad, but I think the alternative off all tests hanging
indefinitely is worse.

In my opinion, the current spinlock implementation is incorrect when the
MMU is disabled, but using a generic implementation is worse. I guess
another thing to put on the TODO list.  Arm ARM recommends Lamportâ€™s Bakery
algorithm for mutual exclusion and we could try to implement that for the
MMU disabled case, but I don't see much interest at the moment in running
tests with the MMU disabled.

Alex
