As it turns out, not all the interrupt controllers are able to
expose a vGIC maintenance interrupt as a distrete signal.
And to be fair, it doesn't really matter as all we require is
for *something* to kick us out of guest mode out way or another.

On systems that do not expose a maintenance interrupt as such,
there are two outcomes:

- either the virtual CPUIF does generate an interrupt, and
  by the time we are back to the host the interrupt will have long
  been disabled (as we set ICH_HCR_EL2.EN to 0 on exit). In this case,
  interrupt latency is as good as it gets.

- or some other event (physical timer) will take us out of the guest
  anyway, and the only drawback is a bad interrupt latency.

So let's be tolerant to the lack of maintenance interrupt, and just let
the user know that their mileage may vary...
