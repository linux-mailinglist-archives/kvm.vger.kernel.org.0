Right. It would have been helpful to mention this earlier. Anyway, I
would really like this to be done without involving userspace at all.

But first, can you please confirm that the VM works as expected
despite the message? If that's the case, we only need to handle the
case where this is a multi-MSI setup, and I think this can be done in
VFIO, without involving userspace.

Thanks,

	M.
