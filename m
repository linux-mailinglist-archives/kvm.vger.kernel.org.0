I removed "mirror" word and use protected for encrypted page table.


    KVM: x86/mmu: Add a private pointer to struct kvm_mmu_page
    
    For private GPA, CPU refers a private page table whose contents are
    encrypted.  The dedicated APIs to operate on it (e.g. updating/reading its
    PTE entry) are used and their cost is expensive.
    
    When KVM resolves KVM page fault, it walks the page tables.  To reuse the
    existing KVM MMU code and mitigate the heavy cost to directly walk
    protected (encrypted) page table, allocate one more page to copy the
    protected page table for KVM MMU code to directly walk.  Resolve KVM page
    fault with the existing code, and do additional operations necessary for
    the protected page table.  To distinguish such cases, the existing KVM page
    table is called a shared page table (i.e. not associated with protected
    page table), and the page table with protected page table is called a
    private page table.  The relationship is depicted below.
    
    Add a private pointer to struct kvm_mmu_page for protected page table and
    add helper functions to allocate/initialize/free a protected page table
    page.  Also, add helper functions to check if a given kvm_mmu_page is
    private.  The later patch introduces hooks to operate on the protected page
    table.

    - Shared PT is visible to KVM and it is used by CPU.
    - Protected PT is used by CPU but it is invisible to KVM.
    - Private PT is visible to KVM but not used by CPU.  It is used to
      propagate PT change to the actual protected PT which is used by CPU.
