Drat.  Is there any hope of pushing through a GHCB change to require the guest
to use PSC?

Injecting a fault, at least from KVM, isn't an option since there's no architectural
behavior we can leverage.  E.g. a guest that isn't enlightened enough to properly
use PSC isn't going to do anything useful with a #MC or #VC.

Sadly, as is I think our only options are to either automatically convert RMP
entries as need, or to punt the exit to userspace.  Maybe we could do both, e.g.
have a module param to control the behavior?  The problem with punting to userspace
is that KVM would also need a way for userspace to fix the issue, otherwise we're
just taking longer to kill the guest :-/
