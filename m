Yah, like stating that something should not be done in the spec is
going to stop people from doing it anyway. You folks need to understand
one thing: the smaller the attack surface, the better. And you need to
*enforce* that - not state it in a spec. No one cares about the spec
when it comes to poking holes in the architecture. And people do poke
and will poke holes *especially* in this architecture, as its main goal
is security.

Yes, this is the thing to do. If they're going to be reused in the
future, then guests can be changed to handle that. Like we do all the
time anyway.

Yes, and pls fix the firmware to zero them out, because from reading
your very detailed explanation - btw, thanks for taking the time to
explain properly what's not in the ABI doc:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220205154243.s33gwghqwbb4efyl@amd.com

it sounds like those two input fields are not really needed. So the
earlier you fix them in the firmware and deprecate them, the better.

Thx!
