Hello!

I am a representative of the ChaosCC hacker group.
In the period from 23/06/2019 to 11/08/2019 we got access to your account kvm@vger.kernel.org by hacking one of the domain.com mail servers.

Your pass for above account on moment of hack was: killing11
You already changed the password? 
Sumptuously! But my program fixes this every time. And every time I know your new password!

Using access to your account, it turned out to be easy to infect the OS of your device.

At the moment, all your contacts are known to us. We also have access to your messengers and to your correspondence.
All this information is already stored with us.

We are also aware of your intimate adventures on the Internet.
We know that you adore adult sites and we know about your sexual addictions.
You have a very interesting and special taste (you understand what I mean).

While browsing these sites, your device&#8217;s camera automatically turns on.
Video-record you and what you watch is being save.
After that, the video clip is automatically saved on our server.

At the moment, several analogy video records have been collected.
From the moment you read this letter, after 60 hours, all your contacts on this email box and in your instant messengers will receive these clips and files with your correspondence.

If you do not want this, transfer 550$ to our Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1WPZhmZ69A9QyYUJkrDiafFkecbdCL6NS
I guarantee that we will then destroy all your secrets!

As soon as the money is in our account - your data will be immediately destroyed!
If no money arrives, files with video and correspondence will be sent to all your contacts.

You decide... Pay or live in hell out of shame...

We believe that this whole story will teach you how to use gadgets properly!
Everyone loves adult sites, you're just out of luck.
For the future - just cover a sticker your device&#8217;s camera when you visit adult sites!

Take care of yourself!
