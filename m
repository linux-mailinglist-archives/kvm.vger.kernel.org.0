That's what the BTS thing does.

Uh what? The code is already setting .config. You just have to change it
do another value.

That wouldn't work right for AMD. But yes, something like that.

It might be nice to emit a pr_warn() or something on the host when this
happens. Then at least the host admin can know he wrecked things for
