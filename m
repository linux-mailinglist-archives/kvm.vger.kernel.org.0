Is it?  The privileged specification says

  Interprocessor interrupts are sent to other harts by implementation-
  specific means, which will ultimately cause the SSIP bit to be set in
  the recipient hartâ€™s sip register.

  All bits besides SSIP in the sip register are read-only.

Meaning that sending an IPI to self by writing 1 to sip.SSIP is
well-defined.  The same should be true of vsip.SSIP while in VS mode.

Do you see any issues in the pseudocode I sent?  It gets away with the
spinlock and request so it may be a good idea anyway. :)
