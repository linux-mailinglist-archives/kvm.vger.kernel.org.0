that's my understanding too. If we keep the current automasked level
sensitive vfio driver scheme and if the guest deactivates the vIRQ when
the guest irq thread has completed its job we should be good.

To me the physical IRQ pending state depends on the line level.
Depending on this line level, on the unmask the irqchip reevaluates
whether it should be fired.
