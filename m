Indeed. Now gone.

I was in two minds about that, as I'd like to eventually be able to
use SVE for protected guests, where the hypervisor itself has to be in
charge of the FP/SVE save-restore.

But that's probably several months away, and I can always revert a
deletion patch if I need to, so let's get rid of it now.

Thanks for the suggestions.
