There are 2 use cases here:

1) Enclave wants to treat host as parent (default). In this scenario, 
the "parent instance" that shows up as CID 3 in the Enclave doesn't 
really exist. Instead, when the Enclave attempts to talk to CID 3, it 
should really land on CID 0 (hypervisor). When the hypervisor tries to 
connect to the Enclave on port X, it should look as if it originates 
from CID 3, not CID 0.

2) Multiple parent VMs. Think of an actual cloud hosting scenario. Here, 
we have multiple "parent instances". Each of them thinks it's CID 3. 
Each can spawn an Enclave that talks to CID 3 and reach the parent. For 
this case, I think implementing all of virtio-vsock in user space is the 
best path forward. But in theory, you could also swizzle CIDs to make 
random "real" CIDs appear as CID 3.

 From the guest's point of view, the parent (CID 3) is just another VM. 
Since Linux as of

 Â https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/20201204170235.84387-4-andraprs@amazon.com/#2594117

always sets VMADDR_FLAG_TO_HOST when local_CID > 0 && remote_CID > 0, I 
would say the message has the flag set.

How would you envision the host to implement the flag? Would the host 
allow user space to listen on any CID and hence receive the respective 
target connections? And wouldn't listening on CID 0 then mean you're 
effectively listening to "any" other CID? Thinking about that a bit 
more, that may be just what we need, yes :)

See case 2 above :). In a nutshell, I don't think it'd be legal to have 
a real CID 3 in that scenario.

As mentioned above, I think there is merit for both. I personally care a 
lot more for case 1 over case 2: We already have a working 
implementation of Nitro Enclaves in a Cloud setup. What is missing is a 
way to easily run a Nitro Enclave locally for development.
