I agree with Cedric. There is no point in a topology object.
The state is calculated on the fly depending on the command line. This
would change if we ever implement the PTF horizontal/vertical state. But this
can then be another CPU state.

So I think we could go forward with this patch as a simple patch set that allows to
sets a static topology. This makes sense on its own, e.g. if you plan to pin your
vCPUs to given host CPUs.

Dynamic changes do come with CPU hotplug, not sure what libvirt does with new CPUs
in that case during migration. I assume those are re-generated on the target with
whatever topology was created on the source. So I guess this will just work, but
it would be good if we could test that.

A more fine-grained topology (drawer, book) could be added later or upfront. It
does require common code and libvirt enhancements, though.
