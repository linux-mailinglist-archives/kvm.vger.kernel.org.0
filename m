I'm worried that the current ratio of development vs review vs testing
is simply not right. We have a huge reviewing deficit, and we end-up
merging buggy code. Some of the features we simply cannot test. It was
OK up to 3 years ago, but I'm not sure it is sustainable anymore.

So making more and more things optional seems to go further in the
direction of an uncontrolled bitrot.

I'm not worried about this get/set thing. I'm worried about the full
end-to-end migration, which hardly anyone tests in anger, with all the
variability of the architecture and options.
