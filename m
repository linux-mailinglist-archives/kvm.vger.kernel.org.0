And I'm going to respond in a couple of mails just for my own sanity.

This is pertaining to me wanting to show you that the design of this SNP
support needs to be sane and maintainable and every function needs to
make sense not only now but in the future.

In this particular example, we should set sev_status *once*, *before*
anything accesses it so that it is prepared when something needs it. Not
do a #VC and go, "oh, btw, is sev_status set? No? Ok, lemme set it."
which basically means our design is seriously lacking.

And I had suggested a similar thing for TDX and tglx was 100% right in
shooting it down because we do properly designed things - not, get stuff
in so that vendor is happy and then, once the vendor programmers have
disappeared to do their next enablement task, the maintainers get to mop
up and maintain it forever.

Because this mopping up doesn't scale - trust me.

So you need to make up your mind here design-wise, what you wanna do.

The proper thing to do would be, to detect *everything*, detect whether
this is an SNP guest, yadda yadda, everything your code is going to need
later on, and then be done with it.

Then you continue with the boot and now your other code queries
everything that has been detected up til now and uses it.
