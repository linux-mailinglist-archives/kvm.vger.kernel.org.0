Hi, folks

Like last year[1], we're aiming to submit a KVM Forum 2020 "recap"
article for LWN.

This won't be a comprehensive summary of a lot of talks â€” LWN normally
aims for 1500 words; they say "fewer can sometimes work, and more is
generally OK too".  Given that, the write-up can cover about four
topics, similar to previous year's recap.

So I'm looking for a couple of volunteers.  Meanwhile, I'll write LWN
folks an email to see if they're amenable to this.  If they can't accept
it for some reason, Plan-B is qemu.org blog articles.

- KVM Forum 2020 schedule: https://kvmforum2020.sched.com/  
- And LWN.net's author guidelines: https://lwn.net/op/AuthorGuide.lwn

I volunteer to summarize Janosch Frank's "The Common Challenges of
Secure VMs" talk.

Let me know, on-list or off-list, on what topic you'd like to pick.

PS: Just like it was noted in the last year's call for volunteers, we
    will not ask LWN.net for money.
