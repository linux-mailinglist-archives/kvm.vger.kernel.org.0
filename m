You are correct insofar as patch 4 replaces the driver_find_device()
function call with a call to AP bus's ap_get_qdev() function which
does not use spinlocks. Without digging deeply into the probe call
chain I do not know whether or notÂ  the use of spinlocks by the klist
code ensures all effects of the probe are seen when we get the
queue from vfio_ap_find_queue(). What I'm sure about is that since
both vfio_ap_find_queue() and the setting of the drvdata in the
probe function are always done under the mdev lock, consistency
should be maintained. What I did decide when thinking about your
previous review comment is that we should probably initialize the
vfio_ap_queue object before setting the drvdata, so I made that change.
