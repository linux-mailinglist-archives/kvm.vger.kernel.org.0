Pasting the reply I sent at [1]:

  I don't really mind how the command is called, but I would prefer
  to add a more complex abstraction only if maintainers of other
  accelerators are interested and volunteer to provide similar
  functionality.  I don't want to introduce complexity for use
  cases that may not even exist.

I'm expecting this to be just a debugging mechanism, not a stable
API to be maintained and supported for decades.  (Maybe a "x-"
prefix should be added to indicate that?)
