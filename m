Greetings,

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never
met before, but need not to worry as I am contacting you for a good
business. I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of
$11.3million to your private account Where this money can be shared
between us. The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for
years without anybody coming for the claim.

I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased
customer (the account owner) who died in a plane crash with his family
since October 2005. By indicating your interest I will send you the
full details on how the business will be executed.

Best Regards,
Michel Duku.
