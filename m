Patch 2 is the only one that seems wrong to me, and I am actually not 
sure why it is part of this series.  It seems to me that it overlaps 
"kvm: x86: move srcu lock out of kvm_vcpu_check_blockâ€‹", for which both 
Sean and I had some discussions on how to remove the side effects that 
kvm_check_nested_events has on kvm_vcpu_is_runn{able,ing}.

Otherwise looks good, and I've already queued patches 8-10.  Holler if I 
should just apply patches 1 and 3-12.
