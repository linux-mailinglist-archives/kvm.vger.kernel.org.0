Subject: [PATCH RFC v2 00/17] KVM: x86/pmu: Add support to enable Guest PEBS via DS 
Date:   Mon,  9 Nov 2020 10:12:37 +0800

The Precise Event Based Sampling(PEBS) supported on Intel Ice Lake server
platforms can provide an architectural state of the instruction executed
after the instruction that caused the event. This patch set enables the
the PEBS via DS feature for KVM (also non) Linux guest on the Ice Lake.
The Linux guest can use PEBS feature like native:

  # perf record -e instructions:ppp ./br_instr a
  # perf record -c 100000 -e instructions:pp ./br_instr a

If the counter_freezing is not enabled on the host, the guest PEBS will
be disabled on purpose when host is using PEBS facility. By default,
KVM disables the co-existence of guest PEBS and host PEBS.

The whole patch set could be divided into three parts and the first two
parts enables the basic PEBS via DS feature which could be considered
to be merged and no regression about host perf is expected.

- part 1: patch 0001-0003: preparation and minor fixes for vPMU overall;
- part 2: patch 0004-0012: enable guest PEBS when the guest PEBS counters
are not cross-mapped, which is the most usual case in practice;
- part 3: patch 0012-0017: enable guest PEBS when cross-mapping happens;

Compared to the first version, an important change here is the removal
of the forced 1-1 mapping of the virtual to physical PMC and we handle
the cross-mapping issue carefully in the part 3 which may address
artificial competition concern from PeterZ.

In general, there are 2 code paths to emulate guest PEBS facility.

1) Fast path (part 2)

This is when the host assigned physical PMC has an identical index as
the virtual PMC (e.g. using physical PMC0 to emulate virtual PMC0).
It works as the 1-1 mapping that we did in the first version.

2) Slow path (part 3)

This is when the host assigned physical PMC has a different index
from the virtual PMC (e.g. using physical PMC1 to emulate virtual PMC0)
In this case, KVM needs to rewrite the PEBS records to change the
applicable counter indexes to the virtual PMC indexes, which would
otherwise contain the physical counter index written by PEBS facility,
and switch the counter reset values to the offset corresponding to
the physical counter indexes in the DS data structure. Large PEBS
needs to be disabled by KVM rewriting the pebs_interrupt_threshold
filed in DS to only one record in the slow path. 

This is because a guest may implicitly drain PEBS buffer, e.g.,
context switch. KVM doesn't get a chance to update the PEBS buffer.
The physical PMC index will confuse the guest. The difficulty comes
when multiple events get rescheduled inside the guest.

Hence disabling large PEBS in this case might be an easy and safe way
to keep it corrects as an initial step here. 

We don't expect this to break any guest code, which can generally tolerate
earlier PMIs. In the fast path with 1:1 mapping this is not needed.

The rewriting work is performed before delivering a vPMI to the guest to
notify the guest to read the record (before entering the guest, where
interrupt has been disabled so no counter reschedule would happen
at that point on the host).

In summary, this patch set enables the guest PEBS to retrieve the correct
information from its own PEBS records on the Ice Lake server platforms
when host is not using PEBS facility at the same time. And we expect it
should work when migrating to another Ice Lake.

Here are the results of pebs test from guest/host for same workload:

perf report on guest:
# Samples: 2K of event 'instructions:ppp', # Event count (approx.): 1473377250
# Overhead  Command   Shared Object      Symbol
  57.74%  br_instr  br_instr           [.] lfsr_cond
  41.40%  br_instr  br_instr           [.] cmp_end
   0.21%  br_instr  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] __lock_acquire

perf report on host:
# Samples: 2K of event 'instructions:ppp', # Event count (approx.): 1462721386
# Overhead  Command   Shared Object     Symbol
  57.90%  br_instr  br_instr          [.] lfsr_cond
  41.95%  br_instr  br_instr          [.] cmp_end
   0.05%  br_instr  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] lock_acquire
   
Conclusion: the profiling results on the guest are similar to that on the host.

Please check more details in each commit and feel free to comment.
