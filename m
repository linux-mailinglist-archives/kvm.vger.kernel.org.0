Not sure what you mean by this reference to MAIR.

These constraints apply to any memory access, including those that are
*not* the direct effect of an instruction.  For example, an atomic
page table update generated by the HW (AF or DB update) is only
guaranteed to succeed if the PTW is itself configured to use ISH+WB or
OSH+WB, and could otherwise result in any of the ill effects described
in B2.2.6.
