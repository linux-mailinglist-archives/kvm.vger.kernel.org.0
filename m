If the command only makes sense for KVM, then it's named correctly, but
the commit message lacks a (brief!) explanation why it only makes for
KVM.

If it just isn't implemented for anything but KVM, then putting "kvm"
into the command name is a bad idea.  Also, the commit message should
briefly note the restriction to KVM.

Pick one :)
