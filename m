Hum, can you please clarify?

AFAIK register spilling is for a compiler, to use memory if it has not 
enough registers.

So your answer is for the my first sentence, meaning yes register 
spilling will be done
or
do you mean register spilling is the reason why the compiler use FPRs 
and it must be done so?

Thanks,

Pierre
