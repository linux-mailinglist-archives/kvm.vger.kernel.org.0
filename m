Yep.

In that case, it's probably a good idea to make KVMI mutually exclusive
with nested virtualization.  Doing so should, in theory, simplify the
implementation and expedite upstreaming, e.g. reviewers don't have to
nitpick edge cases related to nested virt.  My only hesitation in
disabling KVMI when nested virt is enabled is that it could make it much
more difficult to (re)enable the combination in the future.
