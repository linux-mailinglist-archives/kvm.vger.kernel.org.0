In the semantics of "at most one PMI per VM exit", what if the PMI-caused
vm-exit itself triggers a guest counter overflow and triggers vPMI (for
example, at this time the L1 guest is counting the number of vm-exit events
from the L2 guest), will the latter interrupt be swallowed by L0 KVM ? What
is the correct expectation ? It may be different on Intel and AMD.
