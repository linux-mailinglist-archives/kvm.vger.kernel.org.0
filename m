Hi,

I don't think that 'lapic_timer_advance' is designed for that but it does
mask this problem somewhat.

The goal of 'lapic_timer_advance' is to decrease time between deadline passing and start
of guest timer irq routine by making the deadline happen a bit earlier (by timer_advance_ns), and then busy-waiting 
(hopefully only a bit) until the deadline passes, and then immediately do the VM entry.

This way instead of overhead of VM exit and VM entry that both happen after the deadline,
only the VM entry happens after the deadline.


In relation to NTP interference: If the deadline happens earlier than expected, then
KVM will busy wait and decrease the 'timer_advance_ns', and next time the deadline
will happen a bit later thus adopting for the NTP adjustment somewhat.

Note though that 'timer_advance_ns' variable is unsigned and adjust_lapic_timer_advance can underflow
it, which can be fixed.

Now if the deadline happens later than expected, then the guest will see this happen, 
but at least adjust_lapic_timer_advance should increase the 'timer_advance_ns' so next
time the deadline will happen earlier which will also eventually hide the problem.

So overall I do think that implementing the 'lapic_timer_advance' for nested VMX preemption timer
is a good idea, especially since this feature is not really nested in some sense - the timer is
just delivered as a VM exit but it is always delivered to L1, so VMX preemption timer can 
be seen as just an extra L1's deadline timer.

I do think that nested VMX preemption timer should use its own value of timer_advance_ns, thus
we need to extract the common code and make both timers use it. Does this make sense?
