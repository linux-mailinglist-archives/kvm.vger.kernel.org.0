No, we shouldn't sully other code just to keep this WARN.  Again, the point of
the WARN is/was to highlight that any use outside of the hardware enabling path
is suspect.  That's why I asked if there was a way this code could identify that
the CPU in question is being hotplugged, i.e. to convey that the helper is safe
to use only during hardware enabling _or_ hotplug.  If that's not feasible,
replacing the WARN with a scary comment is better than disabling IRQs.
