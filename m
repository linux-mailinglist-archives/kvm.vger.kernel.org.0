Presently KVM only takes a read lock for stage 2 faults if it believes
the fault can be fixed by relaxing permissions on a PTE (write unprotect
for dirty logging). Otherwise, stage 2 faults grab the write lock, which
predictably can pile up all the vCPUs in a sufficiently large VM.

Like the TDP MMU for x86, this series loosens the locking around
manipulations of the stage 2 page tables to allow parallel faults. RCU
and atomics are exploited to safely build/destroy the stage 2 page
tables in light of multiple software observers.

Patches 1-4 clean up the context associated with a page table walk / PTE
visit. This is helpful for:
 - Extending the context passed through for a visit
 - Building page table walkers that operate outside of a kvm_pgtable
   context (e.g. RCU callback)

Patches 5-7 clean up the stage-2 map walkers by calling a helper to tear
down removed tables. There is a small improvement here in that a broken
PTE is replaced more quickly, as page table teardown happens afterwards.

Patch 8 sprinkles in RCU to the page table walkers, punting the
teardown of removed tables to an RCU callback.

Patches 9-13 implement the meat of this series, extending the
'break-before-make' sequence with atomics to realize locking on PTEs.
Effectively a cmpxchg() is used to 'break' a PTE, thereby serializing
changes to a given PTE.

Finally, patch 14 flips the switch on all the new code and starts
grabbing the read side of the MMU lock for stage 2 faults.

Applies to 6.1-rc3. Tested with KVM selftests and kvm-unit-tests.

Branch available at:

  https://github.com/oupton/linux kvm-arm64/parallel_mmu

benchmarked with dirty_log_perf_test, scaling from 1 to 48 vCPUs with
4GB of memory per vCPU backed by THP.

  ./dirty_log_perf_test -s anonymous_thp -m 2 -b 4G -v ${NR_VCPUS}

Time to dirty memory:

        +-------+----------+-------------------+
        | vCPUs | 6.1-rc3  | 6.1-rc3 + series  |
        +-------+----------+-------------------+
        |     1 | 0.87s    | 0.93s             |
        |     2 | 1.11s    | 1.16s             |
        |     4 | 2.39s    | 1.27s             |
        |     8 | 5.01s    | 1.39s             |
        |    16 | 8.89s    | 2.07s             |
        |    32 | 19.90s   | 4.45s             |
        |    48 | 32.10s   | 6.23s             |
        +-------+----------+-------------------+

It is also worth mentioning that the time to populate memory has
improved:

        +-------+----------+-------------------+
        | vCPUs | 6.1-rc3  | 6.1-rc3 + series  |
        +-------+----------+-------------------+
        |     1 | 0.21s    | 0.17s             |
        |     2 | 0.26s    | 0.23s             |
        |     4 | 0.39s    | 0.31s             |
        |     8 | 0.68s    | 0.39s             |
        |    16 | 1.26s    | 0.53s             |
        |    32 | 2.51s    | 1.04s             |
        |    48 | 3.94s    | 1.55s             |
        +-------+----------+-------------------+

v3 -> v4:
 - Fix some type conversion misses caught by sparse (test robot)
 - Squash RCU locking and RCU callback patches together into one (Sean)
 - Commit message nits (Sean)
 - Take a pointer to kvm_s2_mmu in stage2_try_break_pte(), in
   anticipation of eager page splitting (Ricardo)

v3: https://lore.kernel.org/kvmarm/20221027221752.1683510-1-oliver.upton@linux.dev/
