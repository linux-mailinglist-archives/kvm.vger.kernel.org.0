Yes this can change while the guest is running.

The S390 Logical PARtition, where the Linux runs is already a first 
level of virtualization and the lpar CPU are already virtual CPU which 
can be moved from one real CPU to another, the guest is at a second 
level of virtualization.

On the LPAR host an admin can check the topology.
A lpar CPU can be moved to another real CPU because of multiple reasons: 
maintenance, failure, other decision from the first level hypervisor 
that I do not know, may be scheduling balancing.

There is a mechanism for the OS in which is running in LPAR to set a 
flag for the guest on a topology change.
The guest use a specific instruction to get this flag.
This instruction PTF(2) is interpreted by the firmware and does not 
appear in this patch series but in Linux patch series.

So we have, real CPU <-> lpar CPU <-> vCPU

The goal to rearrange the vCPU is to give the guest the knowledge of the 
topology so it can takes benefit of it.
If a lpar CPU moved to another real CPU in another drawer we must move 
the guest vCPU to another drawer so the guest OS can take the best 
scheduling decisions.

Per default, if nothing is specified on the creation of a vCPU, the 
creation is done exactly like you said, starting from (0,0,0,0) and 
incrementing.

There are two possibility to set a vCPU at its place:

1) on creation by specifying the drawer,book,socket for a specific core-id

2) with this QAPI command to move the CPU while it is running.
Note that the core-id and the CPU address do not change when moving the 
CPU so that there is no problem with scheduling, all we do is to provide 
the topology up to the guest when it asks.

The period of checking by the Linux kernel if there is a change and if 
there is a need to ask the topology is one minute.

The migration of CPU is not supposed to happen very often, (not every day).

OK, yes looks better.
