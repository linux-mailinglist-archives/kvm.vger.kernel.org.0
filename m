Thanks a lot for the very timely review!

Naming is hard, yes :). Is "mmlocal" obvious enough to most readers? I'm 
not fully convinced, but I don't find it better or worse than proclocal. 
So whatever flies with the majority works for me :).

I don't fully understand how those two are related. Are you referring to 
the KPTI enabling code in there? That just maps the LDT at the same 
address in both kernel and user mappings, no?

So you're suggesting we use the new mm local address as LDT address 
instead and have that mapped in both kernel and user space? This patch 
set today maps "mm local" data only in kernel space, not in user space, 
as it's meant for kernel data structures.

So I'm not really seeing the path to adapt any of the LDT logic to this. 
Could you please elaborate?

That sounds very reasonable, yes.

Yes, this is a left over bit from an idea that we discussed and rejected 
yesterday. The idea was to have a DEBUG config option that allows 
proclocal memory to leak into other processes, but print debug output so 
that it's easier to catch bugs. After discussion, I think we managed to 
convince everyone that an OOPS is the better tool to find bugs :).

Any trace of this will disappear in the next version.

It might make sense to use it for kmap_atomic() for debug purposes, as 
it ensures that other users can no longer access the same mapping 
through the linear map. However, it does come at quite a big cost, as we 
need to shoot down the TLB of all other threads in the system. So I'm 
not sure it's of general value?
