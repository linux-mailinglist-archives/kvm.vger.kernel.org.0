= Intro =

The patchset brings enabling of Intel Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption.
It consists of changes into multiple subsystems:

 * Core MM: infrastructure for allocation pages, dealing with encrypted VMAs
   and providing API setup encrypted mappings.
 * arch/x86: feature enumeration, program keys into hardware, setup
   page table entries for encrypted pages and more.
 * Key management service: setup and management of encryption keys.
 * DMA/IOMMU: dealing with encrypted memory on IO side.
 * KVM: interaction with virtualization side.
 * Documentation: description of APIs and usage examples.

The patchset is huge. This submission aims to give view to the full picture and
get feedback on the overall design. The patchset will be split into more
digestible pieces later.

Please review. Any feedback is welcome.

= Overview =

Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption (MKTME)[1] is a technology that allows
transparent memory encryption in upcoming Intel platforms.  It uses a new
instruction (PCONFIG) for key setup and selects a key for individual pages by
repurposing physical address bits in the page tables.

These patches add support for MKTME into the existing kernel keyring subsystem
and add a new mprotect_encrypt() system call that can be used by applications
to encrypt anonymous memory with keys obtained from the keyring.

This architecture supports encrypting both normal, volatile DRAM and persistent
memory.  However, these patches do not implement persistent memory support.  We
anticipate adding that support next.

== Hardware Background ==

MKTME is built on top of an existing single-key technology called TME.  TME
encrypts all system memory using a single key generated by the CPU on every
boot of the system. TME provides mitigation against physical attacks, such as
physically removing a DIMM or watching memory bus traffic.

MKTME enables the use of multiple encryption keys[2], allowing selection of the
encryption key per-page using the page tables.  Encryption keys are programmed
into each memory controller and the same set of keys is available to all
entities on the system with access to that memory (all cores, DMA engines,
etc...).

MKTME inherits many of the mitigations against hardware attacks from TME.  Like
TME, MKTME does not mitigate vulnerable or malicious operating systems or
virtual machine managers.  MKTME offers additional mitigations when compared to
TME.

TME and MKTME use the AES encryption algorithm in the AES-XTS mode.  This mode,
typically used for block-based storage devices, takes the physical address of
the data into account when encrypting each block.  This ensures that the
effective key is different for each block of memory. Moving encrypted content
across physical address results in garbage on read, mitigating block-relocation
attacks.  This property is the reason many of the discussed attacks require
control of a shared physical page to be handed from the victim to the attacker.

== MKTME-Provided Mitigations ==

MKTME adds a few mitigations against attacks that are not mitigated when using
TME alone.  The first set are mitigations against software attacks that are
familiar today:

 * Kernel Mapping Attacks: information disclosures that leverage the
   kernel direct map are mitigated against disclosing user data.
 * Freed Data Leak Attacks: removing an encryption key from the
   hardware mitigates future user information disclosure.

The next set are attacks that depend on specialized hardware, such as an “evil
DIMM” or a DDR interposer:

 * Cross-Domain Replay Attack: data is captured from one domain
   (guest) and replayed to another at a later time.
 * Cross-Domain Capture and Delayed Compare Attack: data is captured
   and later analyzed to discover secrets.
 * Key Wear-out Attack: data is captured and analyzed in order to
   Weaken the AES encryption itself.

More details on these attacks are below.

=== Kernel Mapping Attacks ===

Information disclosure vulnerabilities leverage the kernel direct map because
many vulnerabilities involve manipulation of kernel data structures (examples:
CVE-2017-7277, CVE-2017-9605).  We normally think of these bugs as leaking
valuable *kernel* data, but they can leak application data when application
pages are recycled for kernel use.

With this MKTME implementation, there is a direct map created for each MKTME
KeyID which is used whenever the kernel needs to access plaintext.  But, all
kernel data structures are accessed via the direct map for KeyID-0.  Thus,
memory reads which are not coordinated with the KeyID get garbage (for example,
accessing KeyID-4 data with the KeyID-0 mapping).

This means that if sensitive data encrypted using MKTME is leaked via the
KeyID-0 direct map, ciphertext decrypted with the wrong key will be disclosed.
To disclose plaintext, an attacker must “pivot” to the correct direct mapping,
which is non-trivial because there are no kernel data structures in the
KeyID!=0 direct mapping.

=== Freed Data Leak Attack ===

The kernel has a history of bugs around uninitialized data.  Usually, we think
of these bugs as leaking sensitive kernel data, but they can also be used to
leak application secrets.

MKTME can help mitigate the case where application secrets are leaked:

 * App (or VM) places a secret in a page
 * App exits or frees memory to kernel allocator
 * Page added to allocator free list
 * Attacker reallocates page to a purpose where it can read the page

Now, imagine MKTME was in use on the memory being leaked.  The data can only be
leaked as long as the key is programmed in the hardware.  If the key is
de-programmed, like after all pages are freed after a guest is shut down, any
future reads will just see ciphertext.

Basically, the key is a convenient choke-point: you can be more confident that
data encrypted with it is inaccessible once the key is removed.

=== Cross-Domain Replay Attack ===

MKTME mitigates cross-domain replay attacks where an attacker replaces an
encrypted block owned by one domain with a block owned by another domain.
MKTME does not prevent this replacement from occurring, but it does mitigate
plaintext from being disclosed if the domains use different keys.

With TME, the attack could be executed by:
 * A victim places secret in memory, at a given physical address.
   Note: AES-XTS is what restricts the attack to being performed at a
   single physical address instead of across different physical
   addresses
 * Attacker captures victim secret’s ciphertext
 * Later on, after victim frees the physical address, attacker gains
   ownership
 * Attacker puts the ciphertext at the address and get the secret
   plaintext

But, due to the presumably different keys used by the attacker and the victim,
the attacker can not successfully decrypt old ciphertext.

=== Cross-Domain Capture and Delayed Compare Attack ===

This is also referred to as a kind of dictionary attack.

Similarly, MKTME protects against cross-domain capture-and-compare attacks.
Consider the following scenario:
 * A victim places a secret in memory, at a known physical address
 * Attacker captures victim’s ciphertext
 * Attacker gains control of the target physical address, perhaps
   after the victim’s VM is shut down or its memory reclaimed.
 * Attacker computes and writes many possible plaintexts until new
   ciphertext matches content captured previously.

Secrets which have low (plaintext) entropy are more vulnerable to this attack
because they reduce the number of possible plaintexts an attacker has to
compute and write.

The attack will not work if attacker and victim uses different keys.

=== Key Wear-out Attack ===

Repeated use of an encryption key might be used by an attacker to infer
information about the key or the plaintext, weakening the encryption.  The
higher the bandwidth of the encryption engine, the more vulnerable the key is
to wear-out.  The MKTME memory encryption hardware works at the speed of the
memory bus, which has high bandwidth.

Such a weakness has been demonstrated[3] on a theoretical cipher with similar
properties as AES-XTS.

An attack would take the following steps:
 * Victim system is using TME with AES-XTS-128
 * Attacker repeatedly captures ciphertext/plaintext pairs (can be
   Performed with online hardware attack like an interposer).
 * Attacker compels repeated use of the key under attack for a
   sustained time period without a system reboot[4].
 * Attacker discovers a cipertext collision (two plaintexts
   translating to the same ciphertext)
 * Attacker can induce controlled modifications to the targeted
   plaintext by modifying the colliding ciphertext

MKTME mitigates key wear-out in two ways:
 * Keys can be rotated periodically to mitigate wear-out.  Since TME
   keys are generated at boot, rotation of TME keys requires a
   reboot.  In contrast, MKTME allows rotation while the system is
   booted.  An application could implement a policy to rotate keys at
   a frequency which is not feasible to attack.
 * In the case that MKTME is used to encrypt two guests’ memory with
   two different keys, an attack on one guest’s key would not weaken
   the key used in the second guest.

[2] The MKTME architecture supports up to 16 bits of KeyIDs, so a
    maximum of 65535 keys on top of the “TME key” at KeyID-0.  The
    first implementation is expected to support 5 bits, making 63 keys
    available to applications.  However, this is not guaranteed.  The
    number of available keys could be reduced if, for instance,
    additional physical address space is desired over additional
    KeyIDs.

[4] This sustained time required for an attack could vary from days
    to years depending on the attacker’s goals.
