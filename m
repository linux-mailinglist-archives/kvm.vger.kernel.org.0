again, this is all code related to zcrypt card and queues and has nothing directly to do with ap queue and ap cards.
If you want to have a look how this works for ap devices, have a look into the scan routines for the ap bus in ap_bus.c
There you can find a bus_for_each_device() which would fit together with the right matching function for your needs.
And this is exactly what Tony implemented in the first shot. However, as written I can provide something like that
for you.
One note for the improvement via hash list with the argument about the max 65535 objects.
Think about a real big machine which has currently up to 30 crypto cards (z15 GA1.5) which when CEX7S are
plugged appear as 60 crypto adapters and have up to 85 domains each. When all these crypto resources
are assigned to one LPAR we end up in 60x85 = 5100 APQNs. Well, of course with a hash you can improve
the linear search through an array or list but can you measure the performance gain and then compare this
to the complexity.Â  ... just some thoughts about beautifying code ...
