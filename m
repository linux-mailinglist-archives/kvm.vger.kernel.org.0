That's a great approach!

But in this case I think noting a quiescent state in guest exit is 
necessary to avoid a scenario in which a VM takes longer than RCU 
patience, and it ends up running rcuc in a nohz_full cpu, even if guest 
exit was quite brief. 

IIUC Sean's question is more on the tone of "Why KVM does not note a 
quiescent state in guest exit already, if it does in guest entry", and I 
just came with a few arguments to try finding a possible rationale, since 
I could find no discussion on that topic in the lore for the original 
commit.

Since noting a quiescent state in guest exit is cheap enough, avoids rcuc 
schedules when grace period starts during guest execution, and enables a 
much more rational usage of RCU patience, it's a safe to assume it's a 
better way of dealing with RCU compared to current implementation.

Sean, what do you think?

Thanks!
Leo
