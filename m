That's a pretty subtle distinction that I don't think host admins will
be likely to either learn about or remember. IMHO if there are active
SEV guests, the kernel should refuse the run the operation, rather
than kill running guests. The host admin must decide whether it is
appropriate to shutdown the guests in order to be able to run the
upgrade.
