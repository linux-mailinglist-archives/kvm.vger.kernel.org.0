Why do you have a problem with the rwlock?  If it's per-cache, and it's 
mostly taken within vCPU context (with the exception of Xen), contention 
should be nonexistent.

Yes, that's also where I got stuck in my first attempt a few months ago. 
  I agree that it can be changed to use gfn-to-hva caches, except for 
the vmcs12->posted_intr_desc_addr and vmcs12->virtual_apic_page_addr.
