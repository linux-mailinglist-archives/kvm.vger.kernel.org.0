Yes, except the rsdp address is not vendor-specific but an x86 ACPI
thing, so pretty much omnipresent.

Also, acpi_rsdp_addr is part of boot_params and that struct is full
of padding holes and obsolete members so reusing a u32 there is a lot
"easier" than changing the setup_header. So can you put that address in
boot_params instead?

Leaving in the whole text for newly CCed TDX folks in case they're going
to need something like that.

And if so, then both vendors should even share the field definition.

Dave, Sathya, you can find the whole subthread here:

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210602140416.23573-21-brijesh.singh@amd.com

in case you need background info on the topic at hand.

Thx.
