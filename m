I never tried to monitor this, but I had a feeling that it's actually
harder to maintain physical continuity of pages being used and accessed at
least on Linux.

The more possible case to me is the system pages goes very scattered easily
after boot a few hours unless special care is taken, e.g., on using hugetlb
pages or reservations for specific purpose.

I also think that's normally optimal to the system, e.g., numa balancing
will help nodes / cpus using local memory which helps spread the memory
consumptions, hence each core can access different pages that is local to
it.

But I agree I can never justify that it'll always work.  If you or Anish
could provide some data points to further support this issue that would be
very interesting and helpful, IMHO, not required though.

I am not aware of any.

Those numbers can still be helpful.  I was not asking for reproduceability,
but some test to better justify this feature.

IMHO the demand paging test (at least the current one) may or may not be a
good test to show the value of this specific feature.  When with 1-uffd, it
obviously bottlenecks on the single uffd, so it doesn't explain whether
scaling num of uffds could help.

But it's not friendly to multi-uffd either, because it'll be the other
extreme case where all mem accesses are spread the cores, so probably the
feature won't show a result proving its worthwhile.

From another aspect, if a kernel feature is proposed it'll be always nice
(and sometimes mandatory) to have at least one user of it (besides the unit
tests).  I think that should also include proprietary softwares.  It
doesn't need to be used already in production, but some POC would
definitely be very helpful to move a feature forward towards community
acceptance.

Thanks,
