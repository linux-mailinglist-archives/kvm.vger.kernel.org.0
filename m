We'll have to agree to disagree here. Experience has told me that
anything that gets exposed to userspace has to stay forever. There are
countless examples of that on the arm64 side (cue the bogomips debate,
the recent /proc/interrupts repainting).

We had that discussion a few KSs ago (triggered by this[1] if I
remember correctly), and I don't think anything has changed since.

As for removing them, that would probably be best for some (if not
most) of them.
