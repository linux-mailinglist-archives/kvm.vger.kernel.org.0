No, there isn't.

I don't know about you, but I find describing UAPI in terms of "may" and
"whatever reason" quite unsettling. I like to keep my interactions with
userspace deterministic.

Overall, I find the informational capability to be quite superfluous as
it pertains to this feature. Userspace has *explicitly* opted in to a
specific behavior, and the side band capability provides no useful
information. You can easily document KVM_CAP_MEMORY_FAULT_INFO in
such a way that userspace expects to take this sort of exit.

Nobody has presented a use case for annotated EFAULTs on arm64 beyond this
opt-in and there is zero interest in predefining UAPI for anything else.
x86 may've done this a different way, but that's their business.

We're not making UAPI out of any of our other EFAULT returns right now.

The single rule we try to uphold in the kernel is to *never break
userspace*, so I don't see this being in the realm of possibility. The
moment we expose a feature to userspace we're on the hook for it in
perpetuity, and if we break that then you're welcome to send a nastygram
to Marc or I.
