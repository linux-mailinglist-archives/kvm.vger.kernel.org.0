More specifically, it is mandatory for hypervisors to intercept #DB to
defend against CVE-2015-8104, unless they're willing to trust the guest
not to tickle that corner case.

This is believed fixed with SEV-SNP to allow the encrypted guest to use
debugging functionality without posing a DoS risk to the host.Â  In this
case, the hypervisor is expected not to intercept #DB.

If #DB is intercepted, and #VC doesn't use IST, malicious userspace can
cause problems with a movss-delayed breakpoint over SYSCALL.

The question basically whether it is worth going to the effort of making
#VC IST and all the problems that entails, to cover one corner case in
earlier hardware.

Ultimately, this depends on whether anyone plans to put SEV-ES into
production on pre SEV-SNP hardware, and if developers using pre-SEV-SNP
hardware are happy with "don't run malicious userspace" or "don't run
malicious kernels and skip the #DB intercept" as a fair tradeoff to
avoid the #VC IST fun.
