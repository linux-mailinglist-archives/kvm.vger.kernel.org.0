That's not a KVM decision. That's an architectural requirement. Reset
is an exception, exception use the handler mode.

Sure, but that's not what this test (in patch #2) is doing, is it?
If, as I believe, this is an unexpected situation, why not handle it
separately? I'm not advocating one way or another, but it'd be good to
understand the actual scope of the exception handling in this
infrastructure.

If you plan to allow tests to run in the EL1t environment, where do
you decide to switch back to EL1t after taking the exception in EL1h?
Are the tests supposed to implement both stack layouts?

Overall, I'm worried that nobody is going to use this layout *unless*
it becomes mandated.

Thanks,
