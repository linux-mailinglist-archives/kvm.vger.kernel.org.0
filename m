It depends.  The most obvious case is that the host kernel doesn't use
CR4.PSE but we even use 4MB pages to emulate paging disabled mode when
the processor doesn't support unrestricted guests.

Basically, the question is whether we are able to save/restore any
processor state attached to the CR4 bit on vmexit/vmentry.  In this case
there is no PKRU field in the VMCS and the RDPKRU/WRPKRU instructions
require CR4.PKE=1; therefore, we cannot let the guest enable CR4.PKE
unless it's also enabled on the host.
