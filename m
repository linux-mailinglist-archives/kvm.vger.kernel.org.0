Understood, and maybe trying it would answer that question quickly.
Don't get me wrong, just because it appears to work in a few tests doesn't
mean that it really works, but if it visibly blows up, that answers the
question quite quickly and easily.  ;-)

But yes, if it appears to work, there must be a full investigation into
whether or not the change really is safe.
