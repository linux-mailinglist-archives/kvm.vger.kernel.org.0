I think that comes from some other patches of mine, which call the test
on *each* VCPU. There this small delay adds up.

That is one use case, but for the IPI self test we do this on the
same VCPU. My concern was just that those functions are generic, so
should cater for any kind of interrupt tests thrown at them. And as
mentioned above, I had tests which got delayed by the mandatory wait.

For the records: I was coming from my manual testing during the VGIC
development/rework a few years back, where some bugs only showed under
(heavy) *parallel* interrupt load. So I guess I am a bit biased when it
comes to that.

But this is indeed of no concern for what we currently have, so I guess
I will just revisit this as needed, should we get more sophisticated
tests.

Which means the changes here are fine on their own and are definitely
an improvement, so we should go ahead with that.

Cheers,
Andre
