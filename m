Thought about this a bit more whilst being away from a computer...

It all boils down to what we expose as an abstraction of a machine. If
there is no EL2 in the VM, then there shouldn't be any way for the
guest to observe different values for the counters as seen from
different vcpus. That's what the architecture guarantees for a
physical system, and we shouldn't deviate from that. Opening the door
for userspace to do anything differently is a recipe for disaster.

It actually is an argument in favour of setting the various offsets to
a value that keep the two physical and virtual counters in sync,
instead of the current behaviour that allows different values to be
observed.

The above is in contrast with what the architecture allows when EL2 is
present. The hypervisor can naturally deal with the offsets as it sees
fit, and no offset should have any bearing on it (this later point is
of course to be moderated by CNTPOFF on the host).

To sum it up, I'd rather keep the CNTVOFF behaviour what it is today
for guest that have their highest exception level at EL1. For EL2
guests, the setting will obviously have to become per-CPU.
