The devil is in the details.  For example, would you retire uapi/
constants and cause programs to fail compilation?  Or do you keep the
obsolete constants forever?  Also, fixing the mapping from ONE_REG
number to stat would mean a switch statement (or loop of some kind---a
switch statement is basically an unrolled binary search) to access the
stats.  Instead returning the id in KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_DEBUGFS_STAT would
simplify returning the stats to a simple copy_to_user.

Of course, some of the complexity would be punted to userspace.  But
userspace is much closer to the humans that ultimately look at the
stats, so the question is: does userspace really care about knowing
which stat is which, or do they just care about having a name that will
ultimately be consumed by humans down the pipe?  If the latter (which is
also my gut feeling), that is also a point against ONE_REG.

See above: I am not sure they are the same story because their consumers
might be very different from registers.  Registers are generally
consumed by programs (to migrate VMs, for example) and only occasionally
by humans, while stats are meant to be consumed by humans.  We may
disagree on whether this justifies a completely different API...
