While I like this analogy, I don't like the terminology mixed into
linux-mm core.

mm/aeration.c? Bubble? Treated? whut?

Can you come up with a terminology once can understand without a PHD in
biology? (if that is even the right field of study, I have no idea)


ALSO: isn't the analogy partially wrong? Nobody would be using "waste
water" just because they are low on "clean water". At least not in my
city (I hope so ;) ). But maybe I am not getting the whole concept
because we are dealing with pages we want to hint to the hypervisor and
not with actual "waste".

Yes, it is quite intrusive. Maybe we can minimize the impact/error
proneness.

Did you get to test/benchmark the difference?
