Subject: [RESEND PATCH 00/13] KVM: x86: Remove emulation_result enums

Rework the emulator and its users to handle failure scenarios entirely
within the emulator.

{x86,kvm}_emulate_instruction() currently return a tri-state value to
indicate success/continue, userspace exit needed, and failure.  The
intent of returning EMULATE_FAIL is to let the caller handle failure in
a manner that is appropriate for the current context.  In practice,
the emulator has ended up with a mixture of failure handling, i.e.
whether or not the emulator takes action on failure is dependent on the
specific flavor of emulation.

The mixed handling has proven to be rather fragile, e.g. many flows
incorrectly assume their specific flavor of emulation cannot fail or
that the emulator sets state to report the failure back to userspace.

Move everything inside the emulator, piece by piece, so that the
emulation routines can return '0' for exit to userspace and '1' for
resume the guest, just like every other VM-Exit handler.

Paolo/Radim/Vitaly, apologies for the resend, forgot to cc kvm, lkml
and reviewers.
