The philosophy behind -blockdev is that you're explicit about every
image file (and other block node) you want to use and that QEMU doesn't
magically insert or change things behind your back.

For simple use cases that might not seem necessary, but many of the
newer functions added to the block layer, like the block jobs, are
operations that can work on any node in the block graph (i.e. any of the
open images, including backing files etc.). If QEMU changed something
behind your back, you can easily access the wrong image. Especially for
management software like libvirt this kind of magic that -drive involves
was really hard to work with because it always had to second guess what
the world _really_ looked like on the QEMU side.

For example, imagine you open foo.img with -snapshot. Now you want to
create a backup of your current state, so tell QEMU to backup the block
node for foo.img because that's what your VM is currently running on,
right? Except that nobody told you that the active image is actually a
temporary qcow2 image file that -snapshot created internally. You're
backing up the wrong image without the changes of your running VM.

So it's better to always be explicit, and then it's unambiguous which
image file you really mean in operations.
